    Great Value Headset, Can't Go Wrong!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    So let me start by saying I mostly use this headset for Zoom/Teams meetings and some gaming. I am not a serious gamer so I wasn't looking to spend $75-$100+ on a high-end headset. I had a Senty headset that was given to me a few years back and it was good, but had it's own flaws. This headset is actually better than that one. First, the sound quality it exactly what I expected, good and clear. I know it's not going to sound like a Sony or Bose speaker quality, but it was actually pretty great for what it was. I had no issues with the microphone either. Whether I was on a call or playing a game with friends, no one on the other side had any issues hearing me clearly. Setup was easy too, just pull it out of the box and plug it in to the PC. There are also some other cables included like AV cables, but I didn't have a use for those. Overall this headset will do what you need it to do and I think it will impress you for the price point it's at.

    The static is annoying
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I play on xbox and you have to have the wire at a certain angle for people to hear you, when you move the wire you and others only hear static. The headset is really tight on my head and I have it stretched our as far as it can go. It really sucks because I got this headset because my old one was doing the same thing with the wire. Waste of 20$.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The USB only powers the RGB lights - the audio is plain old pin jacks, and if you don't have a pin jack near a USB port (the cables are connected and split into a short Y at the end - then tough luck.I would even have found a way to make that work, though if the RGB lighting hadn't been a letdown. Yes, it illuminates everywhere it promises to, but with the same depressingly dim glow as an old flashlight with half-dead batteries.Meh. Just ""meh.""  I'm returning them.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is a really good inexpensive headset that actually has great sound. They are comfortable as the have cushioning for the top of your head and super soft cushioning for your ears. They‚Äôre not super noise canceling when you have them on without it connected to your console, but once you have it connected, the sound is great and can hardly hear anything. I love the wire because it is wrapped in like a braided fabric so it wont break. It laso has a usb port for pcs and two option wires to plug into your ps4 or xbox remote, microphone or just headphones. Overall great product that delivers without breaking the bank. Definitely comparable to turtle beach headsets.

    It is comfortable to wear so it is capable of playing for a long time without wearing one down. The ear cups are soft and does not scrap agasint the ear. The mic worked flawlessly, much better than the headphone mics I have used before. It fits the head perfectly, there are no strains. Overall, I am happy with this product, but it could be better if it could play heavier bass music or better noise cancellation for mic, but those are basically negelectable when in everyday use.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Checked all drivers, and even reinstalled most things, leading me to believe its a hardware issue. sound randomly cuts out on videos, games, anything really into loud, painful static. It hurts and there's almost no way to stop it except wait for it to subside. Harmful, not worth buying. Doesn't happen with other sound devices on the same computer. Even tried plugging it into my monitor for my computer, does the same thing: randomly turns to ear-piercing, painfully loud static. Wont be buying again. Wouldn't even want a replacement, would just like everyone to know to not buy this and waste their money

    Not a USB Headset
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Searched for a USB gaming headset. These came up. While there IS a USB for this headset, all it does is power the stupid lights. It has no other function whatsoever. Which makes these distinctly NOT a USB headset. They get tinny, mediocre sound via 3.5mm jacks. If you give a darn about sound, these are not your best bet. Other than that, they are comfortable to wear, and they cancel out extraneous noise well.

    All around great gaming headset
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Right away, as I took it out of the box, it is a sharp looking product.  When playing regular cellphone music apps the music is clear and enjoyable, though not loud since the phone doesn't transmit with the same power level as a computer.  It can be used with video face to face, conference calls online such as with Skype and Zoom.  In a noisy environment it can be used to receive and make phone calls on your cell phone. As far as gaming goes I play World of Tanks regularly and it has a great frequency response to the sound effects and I am well understood by the other players in the game through the microphone  If there is a down side, and it isn't much, the owner's manual, as per recent practice, has a font too small for easy reading.  If you look pics you'll a pictorial overview for the connections and the correct way to hook up the headset.  I have worked with other gaming headsets and they only had a USB connection for everything.  This one's USB is only to light up head sets LED lights (pics 1 and 2)..  The 3rd pic shows my front panels USB/3.5mm connectors.  There's an identicle set up on the back panel.  As I said a bit ago the USB is only to light up the LEDs.  The 3.5 mm do all the rest. The red plug goes into the microphone input and the green the audio.  Overall, it's a very good product and I will recommend it to my friends and social contacts.

    Uncomfortable, low quality sound, high price
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Found this product on sale for $30 instead of $80, so I thought I was getting a pretty good deal. Right out of the box put the headphones on and the foam pads are not large enough so the inner diameter speakers sits on top of your ear. I don't think that my ears are abnormally large I believe they are just average lol, but I don't need to tell you that hard plastic clamped around your ear isn't the most comfortable feeling. So anyways, I decided I would still give them a shot even if they were uncomfortable. Plug them in to my PC and man was unimpressed by the sound... my previous pair are $100 hyperx gaming headphones, only $20 more right? However, the sound differences between the two are uncanny. The sound from these headphones sounded dull with no richness to it, low Bass and not much mid-to-high to compliment. This is a great starter headset if you're buying it for your kid and you can find this on on sale for $20 or $30. And I say your kid because they have smaller ears lol and they probably generally won't care as much about the sound. Other than that I wouldn't recommend these headphones especially for $80, that is ridiculous. So I bit the bullet and bought the hyperx MIX headset, more expensive ($120 on black Friday) but at least I know what I'm getting and know what to expect. I love the hyperx headset I would recommend going with a hyperx pair, even if it's their $100 or less pair.

    Noise Cancelling + Large Range of Movement
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Use the headphones for video meetings (Skype, zoom, Google meets, etc) and they work excellent for blocking extraneous noise in my background allowing for better focus in meetings. The cord is more than long enough allowing for a large range of movement perfect for having a large work space. Qualities I am not a fan of but not a deal breaker is that the mic can only be used on my left side and the mic does not appear to be noise cancelling for those on the other end.

    I got these for my granddaughter as a  birthday gift. She had asked for headphones, but was non specific except for the fact that she wanted them to be ""blue"" if possible.  Anyway after looking through all the headsets I decided to get her a set of ""gaming"" ones, and found this pair which featured blue neon lights. Well, when my granddaughter received them she went CRAZY happy!  She was too shy to ask for gaming ones and NEVER expected me to get her a pair! I can't begin to tell you just how HAPPY she was!  I got a million ""Thank you, thank you, thank you grandma!"" from her, which made me really happy that SHE was happy and so grateful and satisfied with her gift! I would HIGHLY recommend this headset for your gaming enthusiast!

    I‚Äôm really impressed with the Donerton J30 Gaming Headset.This is my first gaming headset and it was well worth the investment.  It‚Äôs amazing how it has improved my game play!  By cancelling outside noise, it allows me to focus on the game more intensely and to  hear approaching footsteps, gun fire, and other sound effects.I also use them for work conference calls and found them quite comfortable even after hours of use.  Having the mic volume within arms length his quite handy and call participants verified solid sound quality from my side of the call.The only issue is that I let my kid borrow them to play Fortnite and have to fight for them!

    I was looking at a couple different options in the same price range. In the end, I got these headphones.The reasons I got these were because of the sleek design and blue pop of color. After trying it out, I found it to be- very snug and comfortable- good material- nice sound quality- mic was also working quite well.- Very easy set up- good price for beginner gamers looking for good quality without sacrificing your pocket.

    Sounds Great.  Perfect Addition To My Gaming Computer.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I recently built a new gaming computer and this headset is the perfect addition.  They are comfortable and they sound great.  I love the fact that they have separated the LED Lights using a USB Port.  Therefore if I don't want to use the LED lights then it's a simple disconnect and they are shut off.  It also has a super long cord and volume control on the cord itself.  I didn't really need the Mic but I'm glad it's there.  It will be perfect when I need to have one.  Overall it's a perfect addition to my new setup.  I am glad that I chose this brand.

    Excellent quality overall!This headset is better than I expected. Crisp sound, solid material, and they're comfortable. They even have a thick piece of padding on the part that rests on the top of your head. Another cool aspect to these is that they light up. They do require charging, and one of the things I personally think they could improve is placing the audio jack closer to the headphones themselves so you could charge them while using them. As it stands now both the USB insert as well as the audio jack are at the end of the cord so you have to choose one or the other.Overall this headset is definitely worth the price range it's in.

    I bought these headphones for my son who recently got a gaming PC and he told me they were fantastic. I tried them on and it was a very comfortable fit and the audio quality was excellent as well. Very clear game sound quality and the other players could hear me loud and clear as well. These are nice and sturdy, good build and great overall quality. Will probably buy a pair for myself as my son doesn't want to share them anymore.

    This headset is the real deal! It sounds great, feels great and looks great. The noise cancelling works very well and the volume is very good. The mic level is very good too and very clear. This headset is also very comfortable and doesn't bother your ears if you're using it for a long time. The looks are second to none and it's a quality product, not made cheap.

They fit great and are super comfy. Much needed investment for any gamer. The design is comfortable, light weight and isn't constantly slipping where I have to re-adjust them. I think this is my favorite headset yet.

    At this price range, this headset is very cost-effective. The sound quality in normal circumstance is very good and near excellent in gaming. Although for me it is not so good at noise cancellation, but it is acceptable. When the headset is pulged, it will light up, that is cool! Also, the headset is a little bit tight in adjustment for me, but the quality of it overall is very good.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After about 1 month of use, the microphone stopped staying up- leaning forward even an inch would cause it to fall down into place, getting in the way when not in use.After about 7 months of use, sound started cutting out in one ear depending on how the cord was moved- after 8 months, sound died almost completely in the right ear.While it worked, the audio quality was great- but unless you're looking to buy a new headset every 6-8 months, and don't mind the mic flapping in your face, would not recommend.

I am a girl and wouldn't say my head is ginormous, but dang this hurt my ears for a long time (it's been 4 months of continuous use), even now if I leave it on too long. I put a common plastic water bottle in it to stretch it out when not in use so I can wear it longer. I guess it's nice to know it won't get too loose.

    8 Month Review
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After 8 months of consistent use, I'm finally ready to review this device from the perspective of a post-graduate/student studying for certifications.I'm a somewhat recent college graduate who, before, hadn't read a book since high school and was just as unwilling to go out of my way to buy a book I likely would start to read and forget about halfway through. That said, prior to trying the Kindle out, I was just as unwilling to switch to an e-reader - adamant in my own head that I can't stand reading on anything other than paper. With that out of the way, here's my review.Pros:- The e-paper display, though purely monochromatic, allows for very easy reading that honestly doesn't differ much from printed text.- Due to the type of display used, battery life is almost a non-factor. The 'screensaver' will distract you from that and I admit, it took me a while to get over. If it's that big of an issue, you can always get a case with a front cover (the Kindle will lock automatically when 'closed')- Selection of books on Kindle Unlimited are vast and many. Furthermore, importing other documents or e-books downloaded on your PC is as easy as emailing said files to your Kindle - though the instructions to do so could've been a little clearer. My free time has been taken over as such from reading novelizations of my favorite manga.- If you're a student with a lot of required reading or a need for supplementary material of any kind, I think you'll find the Kindle to save you both time and money (most importantly).Cons:- Aforementioned e-paper display will turn off people who aren't as familiar with the tech. It's nothing comparable to the newer LED/OLED/MiniLED displays on your phones or tablets; it's meant to run minimal power for its function, a feature I came to appreciate but came with some patience as well.- Something I hadn't noticed until using for some time is, though I can always 'zoom' to increase/decrease text size, that I wouldn't have minded going for a larger display - strictly for comfort.- I hate how the 'lock' button is on the bottom. I usually use my pinky for my book to perch on while I read but trying to do so here left me fiddling with a locked Kindle more times than I'd like to count. I countered this by getting a case with a strap on the back by which I can hold the device, but after a while, it didn't take long for me to get over it and avoid that spot entirely.Ultimately, I wish I had purchased this device during college. From a student's perspective, it's invaluable considering the costs of textbooks. Even now, as I pivot from my degree to a totally new field of study, there are countless books on Kindle Unlimited I can use for reference. From deep philosophical thought experiments by Einzelganger to RPi4 and Arduino projects, the Kindle is something you may not use everyday but you'll be very glad you bought one whenever the need should arise.

    First impressions, should you buy one, and how to save money
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still ""suggestions"" on the Home screen that they  consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited ""Free"" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The ""10 weeks"" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My ""Experimental Web Browser"" turned into the ""Web Browser"" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet  Archive), and error messages still mention the ""Experimental"" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.

    a lot nicer than 7th gen...but a bug exists
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen.  I'll do it in 4 points:1-Larger Screen.. Nice2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen.  My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin.  I'm happy around 4700-50003-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.I did not mention the increase from ""4""GB to ""8""GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen  the 4GB  is actually 3.1GB  with the rest taken up by the OS  on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep  the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB!  A bit piggy for me.  I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!.  Most got the joke.CONS: Now  onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:1- ok  the not quite 8GB issue.  Hey  I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional.  If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back.  (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones.  I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music.  But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car.  I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)2- BIG (to me ) BUG  the issue?  as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections.  I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles)  using Calibre.  So  when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections.  sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out.  So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:  01-Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of Dunethen 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:  00-Tales of Dune  01-Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  02.5-the Winds of Dune  03-Children of DuneBUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!  00-Tales of Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  01-Dune  02.5-the Winds of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of DuneThis should REALLY be addressed!3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue.  and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections.  As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series.  And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections.  So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections.  Which went very well ....at first.First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device.  So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle.  Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages  on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did  a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection.  All in one box.  NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box!  You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time.  That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!!  You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over!  Please go back to the old way !!!4- the new Library Series option.  It only works for purchased books, not docs.  also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download.  I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.Well  that's about it.  btw  I  ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice.  I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent ordernow... waiting for a dark brown cork case.______________________________________Slight update or comment on the software version.  My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen.  Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather,  while I wait for the cork.  Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1,  while mine came with 5.14.0 .  I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together.  But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software.  So? What to do?  I've read a LOT on here about complaints  it's so hard, I know.Since my ""update"" was grayed out,  I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen,  and rebooted..and BINGO!  No problem,  I now have the latest software.Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the ""Manage Your Content"" pages regarding using Cloud Collections.  Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower.  Thanks

    Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging StandI own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here‚Äôs some of my particular findings in use.Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don‚Äôt like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device.  I purchased the ‚ÄúMoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear‚Äù from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off.  Thus, having Qi charging is helpful‚Ä¶not mandatory but helpful.  Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS.  The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded ‚Äúoff-line‚Äù reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.Auto-light adjust: I can‚Äôt even detect that it‚Äôs doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature.  Even those that wouldn‚Äôt pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as ‚Äúicing on the cake‚Äù for the price difference.  I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the ‚Äúwith ads‚Äù version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model.  And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly.  It does work with my ‚ÄúMoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear‚Äù., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I‚Äôm watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand.  I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model.  I find no issues with the size of the ‚Äúwall wart‚Äù or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge.  A ‚Äúwork around‚Äù for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.I‚Äôve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúpower user‚Äù. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers.  If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better‚Ä¶that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal.  Happy reading!

    The new paper white is terrific.  Sometimes when making an expensive purchase that I ""don't really need"" I feel a bit of buyers remorse.  But not this time.  I loved this thing right out of the box.  My friends have had different models over the years and I've always been impressed with the screen, and decided to pull the trigger this year on Prime Day.This new model is like reading actual print on paper.  It is very clear, especially outdoors.  I think it is more crisp either outdoors or under a reading lamp.  The text is a teenie-tiny bit fuzzy when using the backlight alone (ie. in the dark).  It totally works, but as a person who needs reading glasses I notice the difference.  I enjoy it most when used outdoors.I've also found that I read faster.  Turning the page is quick and easy.  And the Kindle is very light weight, it weighs less than my iPhone!!  It is easy to hold for long periods of time.Book purchasing is quick and easy.  You can buy on the Kindle, or from your PC and send-to the Kindle.  sorry iOS users, Apple has a stick up their butt so you can't buy from your phone.My only real complaint is the location of the power switch. It sticks out the bottom of the device and is easy to accidentally press.  For example, I was reading on a picnic bench in a park and was resting it and my arms in front of me when suddenly a dialog box appeared ""shutdown, reboot...""  I've also managed to turn it on while in my pocket or carrying it to a different room..  I would have located it on the top or recessed it.Nitpicky ""could be better""  It could use a lock-screen function so that I can carry it to another room. If you accidentally touch the screen, the pages start turning.  Or a different book opens, etc.  Currently the only option is turn it off.  The power options in settings are either ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" .  Maybe they could add a progressive ""soft-sleep for 10 minutes and then go into deep sleep"".  The default deep-sleep takes several seconds to wake up again.  Soft-sleep wakes faster but uses more battery.Another thing, backing up a page requires a Swipe whereas turning forward is a simple tap.  It would be nice if a tap in the left side was backwards (for cases when you fall asleep and the pages start turning :-D )Battery life so far has been 2 weeks between charges.  To get the claimed ""10 weeks"" you need to do a few things:  turn off wifi (apparently this is the big battery sucker and gets you 6 weeks) and turn off the backlight.  And Read Less. :-)  I leave wifi on so that it syncs immediately with my phone.  2 weeks is 2 weeks longer than my iPhone lasts.

    I've had several Kindles for more than a decade now, going all the way back to the Kindle Keyboard.  I usually replace them just to get desirable new features, and also because the trade-in/trade-up is always a good deal.  I read a lot every single day, up to 50 books a year in the past few years by balancing my attention away from so much toxic social media and taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited.  It's easy to get consumed by having a shiny device in your hand with infinite bites of short-attention-span content, taking all your attention away from reading a good book or even enjoying a good show or movie.  The Kindle Paperwhite is an aesthetically pleasing and covetable device that you can turn to for the experience of a beautifully printed page with crisp clean fonts and no paywalls popping up or asking you turn off your ad blocker or accept cookies, or sticking annoying ads between paragraphs.I love that this new Kindle has a bigger flush screen that goes closer to the edges.  I can read in the pool with one hand in extremely bright sunlight without any worries or eye strain.  At night I can switch it ti dark mode where it's white text on black background and puts off very little light to disturb my wife if I'm up late finishing a chapter.  It's got a USB-C port, which I like better because my only problem with older Kindles is when the USB Micro port would start to get loose.  Not sure if that would surely would be improved by this, but the fact that USB-C is reversible might make the difference.  Plus I think it charges faster and that's one less cable to pack.  The new adjustable color temperature setting is a feature I didn't think I'd care about but it's actually nice.  If I do some low-light reading with warmth on 3-4, then switch it back, the screen looks all blue and harsh.  This think is pleasant to read no matter how dark or bright it is.  Finally, it feels like there's still more performance improvements to this one.  It feels faster when I turn the page or scroll through my books.I can tell there's one corner of the screen that's just a bit yellowish even when the settings are for 0 warmth.  Lots of people have complained about even screen lighting in all the different Kindle Paperwhites.  It's probably the hardest thing to engineer, and this is not an expensive device.  What I find is that if the book I'm reading is good, I don't notice it at all.Amazon should do a subscription plan where you commit to 24 months of Kindle Unlimited and get the Kindle PaperWhite included, and then trade up at the end.  They'd still be selling the cases and upcharging for the higher models, but I think that would get more people reading a lot more and maybe draw even more authors to Kindle Unlimited.

    I have used Nook e-readers over the years.  A 2010 and 2015 model.  The 2010 is dead.  The later one is obviously outdated and hasn't been used for a while.  My wife used a very early Kindle Fire, also dead.  So, I was familiar with Amazon's eBook library and we had many books in our shared library.  I decided to update to a Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen) on Prime Day and it has proved a wonderful choice.  I've already read about 10 history books in just this last week and I'm looking for more..At 6.8"", the Kindle screen is larger than I've been used to, but that screen makes reading more pleasant and more like a real book.  I actually now prefer the landscape mode and have added a Pop Socket to hold the Kindle, since the bezel is pretty narrow.  (The PS sticks no problem to the soft rubbery back, after cleaning with alcohol).  I have noticed the back really shows greasy finger marks and isn't easy to wipe clean though.  The light weight and minimal thickness is really nice for holding for long durations.  I specifically don't use a cover, as I did with my Nooks, as that almost doubles the weight and ruins the experience..The touch control could be better, especially when trying to select highlights.  The page turns are awesomely quick and the screen illumination is smoothly consistent across the whole screen.  The 2015 Nook clearly showed where the LEDs were located!  The 300dpi screen is really nice with no pixelation to the letters.  I haven't had any ghosting issues either, with the screen page refresh option off.  The warmer screen option in dark situations is really nice to read with and I have it set to warm automatically for evening reading.  My eyes are much less strained..The non-Signature edition's capacity is fine for me.  I don't need to store the whole world's library on my e-reader.  I like to read no more than a couple books in parallel, with a handful to refer to, as required.  The battery life is absurdly (in a good way) long..In 12 years, the functionality of e-readers really hasn't changed much at all.  The improvements have been subtle, but much appreciated.  The way books are handled in the library is similar too!  The technology development has been much less dynamic on these than say, cell phones.  I guess there's not much you can do when the device is basically just for reading.  Eagerly awaiting a good color Kindle!  (Hint Hint)I do like the more modern design of the screen layout.  It actually is very similar to the old Kindle Fire my wife has and is actually about the same size.  Again, nothing really is that new in the e-reader world. The 11th Gen is now quite a bit thinner and lighter though!.I do wish Amazon, and others, weren't so restrictive with book formats and DRM's.  I can't read my many Nook books on my new Kindle!  There are plenty of books in the Amazon store though and I've already rebought some of my favorites, though reluctantly..SUMMARY:.Loving my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.!  It will keep me entertained and educated for a long, long time.  I highly recommend it.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have a first gen kindle that I received as a gift many years ago and it is still working great and battery life is still strong, and I read a lot. But it had no backlight and was hard to read at night. So, I diddled around trying to decide if I should get a new Paperwhite or not. I saw they were on sale, so I went for it. I bought the bundle deal. It came with the Paperwhite, cover, charger & cable. With the cover it does not seem to weigh any more than my old one without a cover.I have had it a couple of weeks now and I love it. It was so easy to set up and I thought I would have to give up my old kindle if I purchased a new one, but no. Now I have an extra one.I like that the cover that will shut it down when you close it and I do not have to push a button on the bottom. Reading is easy on the eyes; I have left it on the default.  It also can update my Goodreads account.What I find a slight annoyance is that if I leave the book and it shuts down on its own, I cannot just tap the screen to reopen it. I have to close the cover and re swipe to open. Not a big deal for me, just an extra step, but it is just something to note for someone who does not get the Amazon cover.When I received it, the battery was at around 70%. I fully charged it and I have been reading on it for two weeks for about 2 hours a day and it is at 73% right now. So, no complaints about battery life. My other kindle I carry around and read at work and it seems to have a slight longer battery life, but it does not have all the extras the Paperwhite has.

    AWESOME except for missing features and poor dark mode

    This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions!  So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short.  I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight.  But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference).  So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing.  So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading.  Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc.  So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine.  I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing.  I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that.  So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display.  Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.The setting selections are very minimal.  It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion.  Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close.  For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode.  :-)UPDATED 7/26/22:  OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not.  Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion.  Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating.  Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.

    great for travel
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I used to be a snob about paper being better than digital. But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the ""kindle daily deals"" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can ""add to household library"" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!

    I took advantage of Prime Days to get a Kindle. Now, I‚Äôve had a few days to evaluate it.I‚Äôve heard critics of the device say that they want the smell and feel of a ‚Äúreal book‚Äù and have no use for such a new-fangled device. Such remarks remind me of the late Phyllis Diller. She was notorious for her obsession with plastic surgery. When a reporter wanted to know how she felt about people who say they would never have such surgery because they think nature should take its course, she responded: ‚ÄúWell, let those people grow old gracefully then.‚Äù  Fear of anything different seems to hold folks back more than a granite wall.If you think a conventional book is better than a Kindle, you might as well get an icebox, throw out your refrigerator, live without air-conditioning, build yourself an outhouse, and get your liquor from an old fruit jar. Okay, maybe that‚Äôs a little strong; I, too, like holding a book. But from now on, they‚Äôll need to be room in my life for both.Perhaps your hesitation about getting a Kindle is because you don‚Äôt really love reading that much or don‚Äôt completely understand all a Kindle can do for you. The Kindle is to the book what a book is to drawings on a cave wall. In the next paragraph, I‚Äôm going to sell you on getting a Kindle, and I don‚Äôt even get a commission. I will, however, accept your thank you.You probably already know that you can read a Kindle in the dark or outside in bright sunlight, and the screen is no-glare. But did you know that you can press on a word and the dictionary definition will pop up? You can press and hold while you run your finger across a sentence, paragraph, page, or whatever and it will highlight the same way you would use a highlighter for a book. It will stay highlighted unless you delete the highlight. You also have the option to write a note on anything in the text you want: a word, a paragraph, a page, whatever. You can even email your highlights and notes to yourself. When you stop reading, the Kindle will keep your place. The battery life is insanely long, and the device is much easier to hold than a regular book.If that paragraph didn‚Äôt convince you, let me add one more fact: you can get a high-capacity Kindle for a little more money than I spent. However, the one I got ‚Äì the Paperwhite 6.8 -- gives me a good view and, with 8 GB, will hold an average of 2000 - 3000 books. I said, two to three thousand books. Thank me later.

    The upgrade I love but didn't need
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This review is for the new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen (8 GB). First of all, I must say that this Kindle feels great. It might feel a tiny bit heavier than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen, but this is honestly hardly noticeable.I love my old PW and just wanted to upgrade to a newer model because of the slightly larger screen, Bluetooth capabilities, and the warm light.It never occurred to me that I could have any issues with the screen, so imagine my surprise when I turned it on and immediately noticed a dead/stuck pixel on the left upper side of the screen. People on the Internet say this is a manufacturing issue, and there is no way it will disappear on its own. I can see it there, even when the screen is dimly lit. To be honest after a while, I forget it's there and in some cases, the words ""cover"" it up. I don't mind this tiny flaw.The Kindle feels great. Reading is even more enjoyable now. The ability to control the amount of warm light alone makes this Kindle worth the upgrade.I think that 8GB is more than enough if your idea is to store books. Now, if you are thinking of downloading audiobooks too, then 8GB are still enough. That is, if you are not planning on downloading hundreds of books at the time... I rely on the cloud to store my books.It seems that the audiobooks will come from Audible. I don't see (or haven't really looked for) a way to sideload them or use any other store to get them. So, if you're not a prime member or don't have an audible subscription, chances are you won't be using the audio book feature much.I noticed that if you enable the ""listen"" feature, you cannot read along. I can do this on the Kindle App, and as a non native speaker, I like having this option since I get to check on pronunciation of unknown words.Overall, I'm super happy with this unnecessary purchase and fully recommend the upgrade to anyone. I got my new Kindle like two days before Prime Day and paid full price for it... Even at full price, I don't regret it.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I forgot how much I missed a regular Kindle. The last kindle I had was the Kindle fire, so it has been several years. This is much easier on the eyes than the Kindle fire, the Nook color, or the iPad.  And reading on the iPad or the Kindle fire, I found I was always interrupted with a text, or an email, or a phone call when it was linked to my phone. I had initially liked the idea of a tablet that had everything in one place, but it does interfere with reading, I find. I am really liking the Kindle, as just a device for reading.  It‚Äôs also less (or maybe no?) blue light, and I read before bed, so not using a tablet/computer may help or be better for sleep.  It is very light weight, and the suggestions/adds on the lock screen don‚Äôt bother me.  Page turning is easy, but it is sometimes ‚Äútricky‚Äù to get into and out of other menus.  It takes a little getting used to, as the response is different than other touchscreens, in my opinion.  It takes a while to find your ideal brightness and warmth settings (I like about 16-18 brightness and no warmth during the day.  I set it to shift to warmer in the evening/early morning). Just be aware, if you are used to reading on a tablet, you will lose the color images on the Paperwhite.  No big deal, unless you read a lot of cookbooks, graphic novels, or other animated content.  Still, if you have the Kindle app on another tablet or computer, it‚Äôs easy to switch between the two, if you want.  It came 50% charged. I bought the charging plug too.  Like many people state, it should really just come with the plug, but most things don‚Äôt now, so I don‚Äôt really hold that against Amazon in this case.  I‚Äôve always been afraid of using ‚Äúoff-brand,‚Äù discount plugs/cables; so, I figured why not just buy a new one.  I‚Äôve also turned off WiFi to save battery: that‚Äôs not just a toggle on/off, either.  You just have to use the Airplane Mode to turn WiFi off/on.  So far, so good, and I‚Äôm glad I made the purchase.

    Life Saver! Never Gonna Give It Up!

    The Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation is perfect for whenever and wherever you like to read. The warm light option and 8g of storage is a game changer. If you don‚Äôt own a Kindle or want an upgrade, buy this one now!This device is a lifesaver, literally! During a business trip to Costa Rica our yacht accidentally caught on fire which distracted the captain as the ship oversteered, hitting a rock! The yacht capsized and sank into the depths of the ocean along with the entire crew. Luckily I bought the cork cover for my new Kindle and it kept me afloat. After a couple of days swimming, and reading, I safety landed on Coco Island. One day later a fellow crew member made their way to the island as well. Alas, we we‚Äôre the only survivors from our humble business vessel. Unlike the water-soaked book my colleague was able to dredge up on the sand my Kindle Paperwhite was in perfect condition. As dusk fell upon the lonely island I watched him struggle to read as I adjusted the built-in light and turned up the warm light option with ease. For the next eight days he read the same book over and over again (what was left of it). Fortunately for me I had my entire library with me and looked forward to days/weeks (?!) of uninterrupted reading time. On one particularly peaceful day I realized that I had quietly transitioned into the role of our business yacht‚Äôs sole survivor. Anyhow, the next day a rescue chopper found me and delivered me to safety.I am eternally grateful for my Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation. I will never give it up, never gonna put it down, never gonna run around or desert it.

    My previous Kindle Paperwhite was 5 years old and having trouble keeping a charge.  I wanted to upgrade to the new waterproof version, but due to so many negative reviews, I kept putting it off.  Then finally, the deal on Prime Day was too good to resist and I took the plunge.  I do not regret it!First of all, I have a pool and also vacation at the beach often, so knowing that this could get splashed and possibly dropped in the water without being damaged is a huge plus.  I've already spent many hours with this in my pool and so far so good.  I like that the screen is a bit larger than my old one, which is easier on the eyes and less page turns.  The battery holds up just as well as my old Paperwhite originally did.  I can read 5 or 6 books without having to charge.  I didn't think I'd use it, but the nighttime setting is great, automatically adjusting the brightness at a set time of my choosing.The only negatives I can come up with is that the larger screen means a more narrow space to hold the Kindle,  resulting in some accidental page turns.  And I wish there were better options for water resistant cases.  The one I bought is fine but a bit pricey and not completely water resistant.Overall, I highly recommend.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Overall, I LOVE my new kindle paperwhite. Can't stress enough that it really has overall been a great purchase. I love having a dedicated e-reading device as other things don't interupt and distract my reading time, etc... I now refuse to read e-books on any other device as I much prefer reading on my Kindle.Pros:-Absolutely love the adjustable warm/blue light options and dark/light mode (as I can read comfortably in the dark without disturbing others)-In love with the fact its waterproof so I can read in the tub/pool/etc...-wifi connectivity awesome feature-The kindle store experience isn't as good as it is on a tablet/smart phone but was way better than expected-size and weight are just right for holding and reading.-I've read it several hours a day and the battery still managed to last at least a week plus. And if I don't read as often and leave it in airplane mode with bluetooth off it lasts a very, very, very long time without re-charging. So no complaints there.Cons:- Biggest con is as of 2022 kindle paperwhite doesn't support immersion reading (i.e., listening to audiobook and seeing book text at the same time) you can only do one or the other/switch between the two. As an exclusive e-reading device I was very disappointed it doesn't support this particular feature.-It occasionally glitches either skipping ahead by several pages, or makes me tap/swipe a few times when I attempt to navigate backwards in my book. Its not a deal breaker as it happens rarely but still can be slightly annoying at times. This may also improve with updates in the future.-The screen does smudge quite easily/noticably but when reading you can't really tell-a little sad it doesn't have its own speakers to listen to audiobooks, but I knew this buying it and it does connect well to my bluetooth devices. Also, not including internal speakers does keep it very slim which is nice.-There are one or two e-books I own that ""aren't formatted"" for the kindle so I can't read them, but its quite rare. Also I wouldn't recommend reading comic books, graphic novels, or childrens picture books on a kindle as they are all black and white and don't show color (and the pages are smaller and text can be quite difficult to read) However none of these books really read well on normal tablets/smartphones either as they are usually best as hard copies. That being said my toddler still enjoyed reading the one or two kids picture e-books I do own on the device. But its best and really designed for text only chapter books for older kids/adults.Other comments: other reviewers mentioned that the power button is not in a good location as its on the bottom of the device. They stated they occasionally accidentally turn it off while reading (especially if you hold it right handed). I agree its in a bad spot/is slightly inconvenient but it hasn't caused me to accidentally turn it off. So overall this hasn't been an issue for me.Overall I would buy it again, and I would definitely purchase the paperwhite over the standard kindle if you can afford to (although the standard is still a good experience).

    A little more buggy than previous generations
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love Kindle!  I've owned one almost since they were introduced (remember the keyboard Kindle!) and they have literally changed the way I read.  No more locked onto so called best selling authors because now I can discover the absolutely amazing talent that exists out there in the independent world.  It also lets me tote as many books as I want on vacation without needing a separate suitcase for reading materials.And, every generation of Kindle has seen an improvement, some dramatic, some subtle.  This one is on the subtle side if you own a 2018 version.  Yes, the screen is bigger but so is the whole unit (marginally but still bigger) which is not necessarily a check mark in the plus column.  The screen shows fingerprints badly, just like the 2018 version so a screen saver is helpful if you can get it installed properly.  I really like the USB-C charging - a small idea but one I can appreciate.Where I have some issues with this generation is that it seems buggier than any version before.  Sometimes the page forward doesn't work until you do a page back first and then all is well for about another twenty pages and then the behavior repeats itself.  It doesn't always turn on/off with the cover close and I've tried two different covers so think it's the unit itself.  The first thing I did when I took it out of the package was to update it but it has since, on its own, gone into that update screen when there wasn't actually any update to download.  It doesn't wipe anything out, just prevents use for a few minutes.I may have a faulty unit or it's some of the non-Amazon books I'm reading (Gutenberg mostly so they should be malware free but who knows).  It's not enough to return the item since Amazon tends to replace brand new purchases with refurbished ones.If I had but one suggestion for Amazon, it would be to build in a circuit that would allow you to plug a device into the USB port that would have two buttons on a pod and on a longish cord that would let you remotely turn pages.  It would be really helpful in the gym while on the cardio equipment like an AMT.  You could attach the pod to the handles of the AMT and just tap the page turn button to read.

    The best Kindle available - beats Oasis
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    E-readers are supposed to emulate the experience of reading a physical book as closely as possible and this new Paperwhite is by far the best e-reader on the Amazon lineup and the entire market.The 300ppi display makes for ultra smooth and hyper-realistic text (and gorgeous images on the lockscreen). Corners and edges look dangerously sharp, lines look pin-straight and un-pixelated, and adjustable brightness and warm light allow for a perfect combination of comfort and realism. The 6.8"" screen allows for more visible text on a page and is only 0.2"" away from the screen size of an Oasis. The brightness of this display can be turned up to 11 and I highly doubt that anyone, even with impaired vision and in the worst lighting conditions, would ever need to max it out. And I like my screens brighter than most. Trust me, you don't need a higher LED count.The flush-face design is attractive with the downsized bezels around the screen and still provide enough real estate to hold the device. The USB-C port is a must in 2022, the power button is unobtrusive at the bottom of the device (although I would've preferred it placed at the top), and the device itself has a good weight at just under a half-pound. Note: this Kindle is ever so slightly heavier than its predecessors including the Oasis, but is still more than comfortable enough to manipulate in one hand for extended periods of time.The hardware and software pairing as of April 2022 feels well married. Older reviews have expressed judgement of earlier software versions, but as of today I can report no issues. Pages turn a little quicker, loading screens take less time in decision making, and switching between books and other applications feel faster than ever.My only judgements about this Kindle are as follows:I would've preferred different placement for the lock-button but this isn't a functional issue.I wish this Kindle was available in more colors.I exchanged this Kindle before writing this review because I received my first one with a pinhole defect in the display. I believe this was due to shipping conditions because the packaging was minimal and the device was placed at the bottom of the shipping box, underneath only a top layer of bubble packing. So, I wish these shipped with better care.All in all, if wireless charging and auto-adjusting brightness isn't important to you (and it shouldn't be), this Kindle is the one for you. No one needs 32gb of storage in an e-reader, and if you do, it means you're probably neglecting your local library and/ or personal collection of printed books. Shame on you. Thousands of books can be stored in the base 8gb configuration so I truly believe that 32gb is totally unnecessary. Skip the Signature Edition and save a buck.You can always upgrade to ""ad-free"" at a later date by paying an additional $20 so try the ad-supported version first to test the waters. They only appear on the lockscreen anyway. Kindle Unlimited is laughable unless you strictly read B-level romance novels, so feel free to skip a 3 month trial subscription option at the time of purchase if a Kindle without that option selected will ship faster. You'll also get an offer upon setting up your Kindle for the same 3 month trial, so even if you'd like to try it you'll have the opportunity the moment you login to your Amazon account. The offer will also be forwarded to your email upon initialization.Buy this one, you won't regret it.

    I never thought I needed a separate device just for reading. I have an iPad Pro and have always just used that for reading books. The Kindle Paperwhite is night and day. It weighs next to nothing, and is so comfortable in the hand and small enough to go in any purse. I'm not sure what sorcery was used to create this thing, but the screen makes the text look EXACTLY like a paperback book. I spend about 6 hours a day reading books or other documents. I have never had any sort of eye strain that I usually get from my phone or ipad due to the warming feature. It is very easy to upload work documents from my computer to the kindle, and of course the kindle library is massive. The only thing that ipad has over kindle is if you are a big annotator/highlighter when you read. Kindle does have this feature, but it is not as simple as it is on an ipad. Don't spend the money on the ad-free version. The only ads present are when you turn the kindle off and an ad pops up as a screensaver. It's not like an ad will randomly pop up when you're reading or anything.Amazon says that Kindle paperwhite will last about 6 weeks without charge. Like I said, I use mine about 6 hours a day, and I have to charge it maybe every 2 weeks. I still think that is a great battery!

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have had several previous versions of the Kindle and Paperwhite that we absolutely loved. Each version offers more and this one is a no-brainer.  With the waterproofing (which I need with a Granddaughter around) and the new warm light display, this thing is a charm to use and read with.  I keep mine loaded with books and periodicals that could come in handy if my wife goes on a prolonged visit to her favorite stores. It also makes it easier to read in bed even if my wife dozes off, as to not wake or keep bothering her with the light.  It's size is perfect for reading (a little larger than a paperback) and very lightweight. The back helps keep a grip and soft so if I manage to fall asleep while reading, I don't give myself a concussion!  With a newer USB-C port, charging is made easier with my newly purchased Anker charger. The display is now seamless across the screen to the edges making it much better to hold. I know the higher priced Kindle reader comes with physical page-turn buttons, but I have not needed or miss these at all.  Screen refreshes seem much faster on this version also.  If you like to real a lot (or a little) and need a way to read without having to keep a pile of books, this Kindle Paperwhite is the way to go!

    This is a great kindle. It does what it's advertised to do. It's the best digital book you can buy at this price point. It does play your audiobooks as advertised once you pair bluetooth headphones to the device.What it doesn't do that your free iPhone/Android kindle app does is simply a deal breaker for anyone alive today who's brain is rendered absolutely useless by TikTok and other short attention span stimuli. This feature is called immersive reading. And, it's the only way I have been able to ween myself off of my iPhone addiction.I was gifted my kindle for Father's Day. It was a lovely gift. I downloaded a ton of books. I was so excited to read in the pool. I read for exactly 13 milliseconds before I was distracted. I sat by the pool and read for another 23 milliseconds before I picked up my iPhone and scrolled through TikTok for the next consecutive 4 hours.I then found, what I learned to call, immersive reading by searching for ""can audible read my kindle books to me"". Immersive reading is absolutely fantastic. It reads the book to you and highlights as it's reading. You're reading along as the audio keeps you focused. I have plowed through 400 and 700 page books in days like I was back in middle school. This can't be my same brain....I have abandoned my kindle, for now, to use immersive reading on my iPad and iPhone. I hope to return a recovered iPhone addict one day. But, I would also return should a software update bring this feature to the kindle paperwhite. I do not think I would buy a newer/other kindle model to get this feature. It's just to easy to use the IPhone/iPad app for no extra cost..

    My old kindle was the keyboard, and I love my kindle I just would get into issues where I would read so late in the night and I had to have a light. It would wake my husband. So I wanted the illuminated screen. For me I go dark mode. I prefer it black with white lettering. It is still illuminated but not so much that it is too bright. I have found it easy to maneuver around in it and my books are great. I like I can just tap screen with my thumb too. Very easy reading! I love it so much and I am glad I finally switched! I sat on it a long time trying to decide!What I also love is it connects to amazon kids too for my kids reading books!!!I find the response time is perfect for me, and again easy to use. Very happy I got it.My only thing is there was one small pixel out and I was trying to decide what to do about that. But it isn't anywhere that bothers me too much. So I just went with it. Love it!And I love the old one too, I just like that this has the illuminated screen and touch.Oh and it is water safe, which I see others are like but why!?! But me I love taking a bath and reading and now I am not worried if I accidentally drop it. Which I have done before.

    This is personally my 3rd Kindle, 1st in the Paperwhite series.  This is the 6th Kindle and 3rd Kindle Paperwhite we've had between my wife and I. This Paperwhite 11th Gen is replacing my Kindle Voyage.  The Voyage was smaller, lighter, and had a longer battery life (in the beginning). But the Paperwhite 11th Gen is still a better device.  On the Paperwhite the screen is more adaptable to light changes and slightly more touch responsive, the device charges faster, and I like the operating system better (software and hardware). I've only had t for a week so I haven't run it through all it's paces yet, but I am excited about the water resistance and potential for Bluetooth connection. I read while floating in a pool or while sitting at the beach so I expect the water resistance feature will come in very handy!I did have 1 hiccup with the device.  Last night the touch screen  suddenly stopped responding. I couldn't open the menu or turn the page.  I pressed the power button to put it to sleep, waited a few seconds, and then pressed the power button again to wake it back up.  I suspect the more advanced software will need to be rebooted occasionally (like a cellphone or computer needs to be rebooted occasionally). This is probably a minor thing, but it could be annoying for someone who's not used to trouble shooting tech issues.

    I have an 11 year old Kindle 3 with Keyboard that is still working perfectly. I decided to trade it in on Prime Day for the Paperwhite to test out the new features. Big mistake.One of the biggest differences is supposed to be the improved screen resolution. That might be the case for illustrations, magazines, or comics, but I don‚Äôt use a Kindle tor that. I could not see any significant improvement when it came to books. One nice addition is the lighting range where you can go from the brightest bright to a reverse darkness with white lettering on a black screen for late night reading. I will miss that but the old black lettering on a grey screen has always been a good middle ground for me. The Paperwhite screen is also bigger for fewer page turns and that was nice but it also shrunk the border bezels which caused other problems.  But page turns were a mess.A light tap on the right side of the screen would often jump ahead two pages and the same could happen going back. It happened enough that I couldn‚Äôt trust I was on the correct page. Two times a single tap advanced close to 40 pages. There is an option to turn off the touchscreen and just swipe to advance pages but when I did that the screen would freeze up and not respond to swipes. Well this is an enjoyable way to read.Regarding the thinner bezels: if you have large hands, reading can be a bit like whack-a-mole. If you are holding it with one hand, which I do most of the time, it is easy to inadvertently brush the screen which results is a page turn you didn‚Äôt want. At that point you just feel lucky if it only advanced a single page. My old Kindle 3 is a bit larger and a few ounces heavier but I find it much more comfortable to hold in one hand, especially with the page buttons. The Paperwhite really needs a screen sensitivity option.So I decided to return the Paperwhite and keep my old Kindle. The battery will eventually stop working but I can replace that for $15.00. So I deregister the Paperwhite for shipment and now it would not power off. I tried everything short of a hammer. After wasting a half hour I called Amazon for assistance as I didn‚Äôt want to pack a powered device and at this point I knew it was not going to turn itself off. The rep was great and it still took 75 minutes on the phone to shut it off. At one point I asked the rep if I could bash it to death with a hammer and use our recorded call as justification for the exchange. Or drive a stake through its Kindle heart. I believe she gave it serious consideration.There were some other nice menu options but who cares if reading a book is so dam frustrating. I could have exchanged it for another one but in those cases Amazon may replace it with a returned/refurbished item. Not a new one. I know the vast majority of people are very satisfied with the Paperwhite but they don‚Äôt know how great the Kindle 3 still is, even with the physical keyboard that takes forever to enter anything.

    This Kindle replaces my nine year old one, and its come a long way!  It‚Äôs slightly bigger in size to hold, compared to my older one, but the differences are amazing in the workings of it.  It is very touch responsive.  Just a quick touch and it turns the page forward or back.  Same for the settings at the top.  Everything is so quick.  It took me a bit to figure out all the settings and I think I am still learning, but its been great fun.  Before I got my cover for it, I had to turn it off and on manually.  The screen would pop right up.  Now with the cover it puts it to sleep when I close it, and turns it on immediately when I open the cover.  Such a difference from my old one!  And the screen is so much brighter and crisper and clearer.  It‚Äôs such a pleasure to read from it!

    Love my latest kindle!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I bought my first kindle paperwhite almost 10 years ago.. since then I have bought about 8-9 devices.. mostly fire tablets as a gift for family.. nephews and nieces. But I stuck to my original kindle paperwhite since I loved the natural feel of the screen. Finally after nearly a decade and slowly down significantly, my kindle paperwhite died. So I started looking for a replacement among all these ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù of kindle  and fire tablets. Finally I found this one during Prime Day, it had great reviews, I got a major discount due to prime day and it was shipped to me in 2 days. The transfer of all my books was super easy from the kindle website. The new one has a lot of space for storing more books. It has audible functionality added too. Last but not the least, it still has the perfect screen for reading.. ‚Äúpaper white‚Äù is not false advertising. Now I‚Äôm the settings, with brightness you can also adjust warmth. This is especially helpful for me since I read at night in bed. Also if you purchase or borrow books in a series, it puts them all together in serialized format so you can find it in one place in your library.All in all, I‚Äôm very happy with my kindle, I hope it survives my reading habits and lasts a decade like my old one. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

    Since the very beginning of the e-reader era, I had always sworn I would never purchase one.  I was proud of being a biblio-purist, and felt that e-readers we're an affront to the ancient, iconic charms of printed literature. Reading a good book could  not possibl provide the same experience when done so through the cold and impersonal electronic haze that encased e-readers.  How could one derive the same experience that was provided from physical flipping throught dog-eared pages showing sings if all those who had tried through those printed words countless times before, and more to come.  Feeling the best of it in your hands carrying the weight of reality, the ever-changing smells that evolved during a book's lifetime from papermill-new, the must and dust that could create olfactory imagery from old, well-used libraries, and the character of cigar-lounds and cognac snifters.  These sensations could add timeless, hefty qualities to the works of literature contained therein.  I also found afront in that electronic literature kept readers away from the already dying icon of the corner bookstore, and the charms of slowly perusing aisles and aisles of books with others who shared a similar driving passion.  And to sip an afternoon capucino on the front patio of such a bookstore was a sublime pleasure that compared to no others.Then slowly, insidiously over the course of years, my reading frequency decreased.  Part of it was due to the inevitable demands for time and attentions that increased age brings with increased responsibilities, but a large part was played by less and less time and energy I had available to make it to the bookstore or library.  Slowly at first, but inevitable to the point at which I had simply quit reading without being accutely conscious of it.  In would purchase an occasional book, but found that reading simply had become increasingly difficult to make happen.  Books would get left in public places, or otherwise lost.  Finding room for one in napsack before going on an afternoon bike ride impeded the desire to read.  Sometimes I justwould tire of the unavoidable spills, stains, and mistreatments that eventually occured to my books, through no lack of love but due to my somewhat active and chaotic lifestyle.Then one day after watching a new film adaptation of one of my favorite novels, I had the strong urge to re-read the book.  I, however, was on a late-night work schedule that made it extremely challenging to conduct any sort of business or errand-running during daylight hours.  Being a devoutly active Amazonian, I was aware of a recent significant sale on Kindles.  I ran through a few thought-processes and determined there was little risk of harm in making a small investment in the potential re-Kindling of a long-lost love.I can't put my Kindle down.  I am utterly amazed at the e-ink technology that allows this reading magic to happen.  I'm in love with the changeable, resizeable fonts (I can actually read even if I've mis-placed my glasses).  The dictionary look-up feature, the ability to highlight passages, easily flip through pages and bookmark them easily, the adjustable side-lighting and color temperature... have all enamored me with the device and customizable technology.  And the ability to carry an entire library around with me in my pocket still boggles my mind!I have read more in the month and a half that I've owned my Kindle than I have in the last 2 or  3 years.I'm a romantic, tactile person, and while it is a bit nostalgically sad that independent booksellers are losing business and may indeed be a dying breed... well, times change and not always in the precise way we'd like them to.  But if e-readers can promote and increase reading and the appreciation of literature, while possibly removing some roadblocks to publication for young, unestablished authors... well I can't see that as a bad thing.

    I've been reading on my Fire 8HD for years. In the past I've kept an old Fire for reading and used a newer one for games, videos, and everything else, but my ""old"" Fire died a few months back and I'd been trying to decide whether to replace it or get the Paperwhite. I wasn't really sure I needed a Paperwhite. It made no sense to me that my Fire cost less than a Paperwhite, so I wasn't rushing to buy one in spite of the rave reviews. Recently when I wasn't feeling well though, the reflections on the Fire's screen were bothering me and my eyes were getting tired. I'd never really noticed the reflections because I usually read at night in the dark, although it has been a bit of a bother reading on airplanes. That got me thinking that maybe a Paperwhite was something to consider, but the screen looked awfully small and I thought that might be annoying.  I decided to wait for Prime Day and get one with the birthday gift cards I knew were coming. I'm so glad I did! The Paperwhite is so light! It's a lot lighter than a book or my Fire. I got a case that has double hand straps so I can hold it comfortably in either hand.  It makes reading more enjoyable because I don't get tired of holding it, and I can read in any position. It looks cute on my nightstand in its pretty cover too. I haven't even played with any of the settings, but I'm now a Paperwhite fan.

    I bought this on prime day, with the case and charging combo. My boyfriend told me I should buy one as I always read books on my phone. I didn't think it would be a huge improvement to my phone, I didn't think I would use it nearly as much as I have been! This is amazing. I love how crisp the text is and how easy it is to customize the font type, size, and boldness. Downloading new books is simple, having kindle unlimited is great, so many books are offered.  When reading before bed, I turn the warmth up and it doesn't hurt my eyes at all. I just can not get over how crisp the text is! I love how it is lightweight and easy to hold. The water resistance is a plus, have yet to read in the bath! Lol.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve been on the fence for years on buying a kindle. Decided to get one on the recent Prime Day deals. Chose the Paperwhite over the base model due to higher ppi and water resistance.Never owned a kindle before so not sure but from reading reviews the Paperwhite is supposed to have a more responsive screen. The base model must suck because the Paperwhite is sluggish in 2022 compared to a smartphone or tablet. If my iPad were so slow, I‚Äôd throw it against the wall. BUT, as the kindle is purely for reading and nothing else it is totally fine. The delay when pressing a button and getting the desired response is minimal and acceptable for browsing the store and turning pages. That‚Äôs really the only negative and it is easily forgivable.After having tried to read a few books over the years on an iPad, the kindle is a revelation for my eyes. No strain and a very comfortable and pleasant reading experience. Have read for hours on end which was never really possible or enjoyable on an iPad. Love that it is waterproof and can use it at pool or beach.With the ability to borrow ebooks from my local library, this thing is amazing and well worth the initial investment. If you read novels and like to get lost in them for hours on end, it‚Äôs a no brainer. Makes borrowing library books much more convenient, as well as saving money vs physical prints of a book. Save money, no waste. Battery lasts forever too.

    All good except I miss dedicated page turn buttons like old Kindles or Voyage
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Everything is good in this new Paperwhite model, I like the bigger size and the backlighting with variable ""warmth"", plus the optional dark mode of white text on black background for night reading.I don't like the lack of dedicated page turn buttons -- I've always had older Kindles with buttons, most recently a Voyage, and I find it distracting and annoying to have to touch the screen carefully somewhere on the righthand side to advance forward one page, especially if I'm trying to hold the device in just my left hand, as I would often do with the older models having dedicated page turn buttons along the left edge. So I can't use this Kindle entirely one-handed like I used to with older ones (even holding it just in my right hand, it's awkward having to extend a finger carefully to touch somewhere in the righthand side of the screen to advance the page forward instead of just having a nice button to press).Oh one other thing that's sub-optimal is that in the new OS/UI there's no more generic/universal ""Back"" button/link icon. Most noticeable when I'm reading a story in a magazine; with older models and older OS/UI there was a ""back"" button, either hardware or software, so I could use the ""home"" button/link icon to jump out to the ""library"" listing, and then use the universal ""back"" button/link icon to jump back directly to the page I'd been reading in the story in the magazine. Now I have to go through several steps, thinking about what to do/touch next, to go through this cycle, and it annoys me each time.Plus, one more thing I don't like in the new OS/UI is that in the Library listing when I have some Collections, previously in the overall view it would only show collections and individual items that weren't in any collection. So I could ""hide"" a bunch of books inside collections, not having to scroll past them in the main library view of items not in any collection.But now, in the overall view, it shows collections and ALL downloaded individual items, including ones that I wanted to hide from this view by putting them in a collection. What's the point of adding them to a ""collection"", if they're still just going to all be visible in the main library list?Other than these few things I don't like about the new OS/UI and the lack of a physical page forward button on the left or bottom edge of the device, I do like this new Paperwhite (it's my first Paperwhite; I had the original Kindle when it first came out, then some years later I had one with no keyboard but still having physical buttons along the bottom and sides, and then I had a Voyage for a few years, before deciding to upgrade to this new Paperwhite).

    My Gen. 11 Kindle Paperwhite has adjustable warm light (yes!), and a larger screen at 6.8‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt sound like a much bigger screen, but the outer dimensions add up to feeling more like a book, at 4.9‚Äù x 6.9‚Äù overall. I find it easier to read than my previous Kindles, and I always add the Decal Girl matte ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù skin. I also find it useful to have the Spigen grip on the back near the top, as the edges are narrow. A PopSocket would work, as well.

    I had previously read my kindle books on my phone (hard on the eyes) , or on a couple of laptops. (Better on the eyes but bulky).  After getting the Kindle paperwhite, I've been reading tons more because it's just soooooo much easier on my (admittedly old) eyes.  The size is something close to a small paperback. Just a bit big for a pocket.  But who stuffs a book into your pocket?It does pretty much suck as a general browser.  But I have my phone and laptops for that.Getting new content is best done on the phone or laptops and specify delivery to the Kindle.The touch controls require a little trial to get used to.  But they are needed very little compared to the time you are just reading.I'm really glad I got it.

    Over the years I've owned just about every kindle that Amazon has offered. What a long ways they have come from the very first one! This new Gen 11 Kindle is very easy to use and is very similar to the 10 generation but with some nice upgrades. I was very happy to see that the larger screen did not add any noticeable weight compared to the 10 generation Kindle. The larger screen is great for us who have older eyes lol. You adjust the letters to make them little bigger in size on this 11 generation Kindle. I also love the feature with the amber night light. Now you can read in the dark without eye strain from a brighter lighted screen. Also, this new Kindle was so easy to set up! Out of the box I just turned it on, set up the Wi-Fi code, and entered my Amazon account information and all my books from my 10ty generation Kindle were right there waiting for me. The touch screen is much more responsive on this new kindle and the settings are easier to work with now. All in all very happy with my new kindle 11th generation.

    This is a nice Kindle to read, I bought this to replace my 8 year old Paperwhite which I broke the screen.This one is easy to read, visually, it's a nice improvement.The low rating is due to almost daily needs to restart the device.  I'll open the Kindle to a white page, I then have to restart and reopen the book that I was reading.  I also frequently lose the progress that I had when I need to restart.This would get a 5 star rating if it worked as well as my old Paperwhite.  I think I needed to restart that twice in 8 years.Note:  I am leaving my original review above, after posting the review, I received an email from Amazon customer service with instructions on correcting the problems I listed in the original review.  The Kindle works as expected now.  I am also happy with the unexpected email from Amazon.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    So, I never really thought I would get this version of the kindle because well a kindle isn't really something that you upgrade when the new version comes out. It's something that you upgrade when your old one breaks, and you must upgrade it. Well, I lost my 10th Gen kindle paperwhite at work, so I decided to order this one. I love it. The newer display refreshes just a bit faster than the older one did, and the fact that it's bigger and has smaller bezels really does a lot to make this new kindle feel modern. Another thing is that it now charges via USB C. This is amazing because it means every single one of my portable electronic devices can be charged with my laptop charger.The one real complaint I have with my new Kindle is the physical size of the device. While I appreciate the larger screen, they wish they could have shrunk the bezels on the older model without actually making the footprint bigger. As a guy who usually wears cargo shorts or cargo pants I could always put my old Kindle in my front pocket. I never had to think about putting it in a bag or make sure that I had a jacket pocket to put it in because it would just fit in my pants or shorts pocket. This is a minor complaint, but if you have an older candle and it fits very exactly into a pocket or bag the new one might not fit as well. Also, Amazon please stop putting the power button on the bottom of the device. Put it on the top of the side, it would be more ergonomic there.

It's super light weight and easy to take in my purse to get my nails done, wait at the doctor's office, etc. and I'm reading so much more because of it. I do recommend a case as the screen scratches pretty easily, especially if putting it in various bags/purses versus just sitting on your nightstand or around your house. There are a lot of features to adjust to the perfect reading light and brightness/warmth, and I love being able to read at night without an overhead light or lamp on.

    Got this to read outdoors/after a long day of working on computers to help my eyes with strain. This style of screen is SO satisfying. I tried an old version to see if I would like this style and this is thinner, with more screen area, and moves much more quickly than older models. I was able to get it at an incredible deal during a sale and it was more than worth the $80 I paid. My new favorite device for sure. I'm reading more and it helps with my unwinding routine at night to not look at another bright screen. A physical book is lovely but I only have so much space - renting ebooks from the library is easy to do and I can take multiple books with me everywhere now. I got the ad-supported version and it doesn't affect my experience. Battery life is incredible.

    I purchased this Kindle on a whim and was mostly curious about how it felt to read on an e-ink display since I had heard so much praise regarding it. Prior to this, I regularly used my iPad or iPhone to read, the iPad being much more convenient due to its large size. I don't think I ever really felt any eye strain using those, but the Kindle has undoubtedly been the most comfortable to use by far. I've used it at night with all the lights off and it still feels comfortable to use -- I didn't feel like I had to squint due to its brightness -- and I've also used it under direct sunlight, where it felt just as natural as reading on paper. I definitely did not expect myself to enjoy reading on a Kindle this much, but after trying it, I can confidently say that if given the choice, I wouldn't go back.

    This is an initial impressions review. I‚Äôll come back to update if opinions change.The Kindle arrived within a day which is appreciated. I got a Kindle because I‚Äôve been reading on my iPad through the Kindle app and was looking to consolidate. The iPad was used only for reading and I didn‚Äôt need it for anything else. The Kindle lags compared to the iPad. I‚Äôve also had it freeze on me a couple of times. A couple of time in 24 hours is not promising!  I like that the Kindle is compact and light. Easy to throw in my purse and take anywhere. I also like that you can read it anywhere at any time of day even with all of the lights off. I fully charged the device the day I received it (yesterday) and today it is down to 90% battery life. I have been downloading and playing with the features so maybe that is why but at this rate it will not last 10 weeks on a single charge as advertised. I thought it was a bit cheap of Amazon not to include a wall plug for the charger cable. I have some Apple wall chargers flying around and those seem to work fine, but if you don‚Äôt, this aspect might be annoying to you. It takes a little while to figure out how to navigate around because there are literally no instructions. That‚Äôs fine for me, I don‚Äôt read instructions, but keep this in mind if you are gifting this to someone that is not tech savvy. I had to Google how to get back to my home page after reading my book because I just could not figure it out (tap the top of the Kindle screen for options). I like that you can browse the Kindle store directly from the device and make purchases. I don‚Äôt think I was able to do that on the Kindle app on my iPad. Am I still glad I bought a Kindle?  I think so. Time will tell if the freezing issues and lag time when scrolling cause too much frustration.

    Great New Kindle!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My old Kindle started acting a bit wonky, so Amazon Prime day came along and I thought it might be a good time to get a new one.  I love the new Kindle.  It's a little larger and faster and the battery life is impressive.  I like that it uses the newer 'C' type charging cables, so now all my devices use the same cables.  The only thing I don't like about this new version is how my books are originally organized.  I'm hoping that I can organize them differently.  Just haven't gotten to it yet.  Plus, how the books are listed has changed.  Rather than just the title and author, there's a picture of the book itself.  Again, perhaps this can be changed.  I need to look.  Other than these minor annoyances, I love the new Kindle.

    The Paperwhite I have been waiting for
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Kindle Paperwhites don't get updated very often, and each of the previous two models (2015 and 2018) have been only SLIGHTLY improved from their predecessors.  This has been frustrating, because the underlying technology has improved, and I've felt the Kindle could be so much better.  But Amazon has little competition in the e-ink e-reader market (the Kindle's market share is around 75%, the other 25% is all other brands combined), so Amazon has little incentive to pack the latest tech into their devices.But the 2021 Paperwhite is a big leap forward, compared to the 2015 and 2018 models.  The biggest improvement is the screen quality:  sharp, dark text and the ability to adjust the warmth of the background  makes it look much more like paper than ever before.  This significantly improves the reading experience, and eye comfort.Second is the size of the display, which is now 6.8"" diagonally compared to 6.0"" for previous models, which makes it taller and wider.  The difference between the new & old screen size is similar to the difference between a trade paperback (which is nearly the size of the hardcover version, without the hard cover) and a mass market paperback (which is significantly smaller than the hardcover version, with pages that are more cramped with text).Third is the size of the bezels around the display.  The bezels on the 2018 and earlier models look very chunky compared to the narrower bezels on the 2021 model, which are narrower yet still big enough that you can hold the Paperwhite without your fingers blocking the screen.  This change is cosmetic, and some people won't care about it.  But many people like the narrower bezels, and also it means that more of the device is screen so you're getting a bigger ratio of screen to overall size & weight.Speaking of that, the 2021 model is slightly bigger and very slightly heavier than the 2018 model.  I compared them side-by-side, and the differences were apparent.  But after using the new model for 15 minutes, I didn't care and haven't given it a thought since.I've now had my 2021 Paperwhite for 5 weeks and I've read 4 books on it.  I've definitely had a better experience with it than any previous Paperwhite model I've owned.  Even my wife, who normally has zero interest in updating her tech unless her old model stops working, ordered a 2021 Paperwhite once she saw how much better mine is compared to the previous gen Paperwhites we both have been using for years.When we bought ours, Amazon gave us each $28 in trade-in credit for our previous Paperwhites plus a $25 discount, so the net cost was around $90 + tax each.  Not bad!  Though if I had to pay full price, I happily would, knowing how much better the 2021 Paperwhite is.One last thing:  don't buy Amazon's leather cover for this new Paperwhite.  It's a big step down from the leather covers for the 2015 & 2018 models.  Read the user reviews, most people really dislike it.  On the other hand, Amazon's fabric cover is very nice, and there are third-party covers that are good to great and cost less than Amazon's own covers.Happy reading!

    Much better than previous paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This generation of paperwhite is much better than the previous one.  The screen is larger, but still small enough to fit in my back pocket.  I do miss the colors.  We have a few of these in the family and it was to have them in different colors.  The screen is somewhat sensitive and I find it unintentionally flips pages (forward or backwards).  However, these are minor inconveniences given the high quality product.

    This kindle does not hold a charge like the reviews indicated.  I had to recharge after less than week and get a message of an application error almost two times a week on machine.  You can click ""okay"" and it goes away.  If you buy this as a package and trade in your old kindle on the same order.  you don't get the 20% rebate only the $25 for the kindle trade in.  In order to get the 20% rebate. you have to place your order later by returning the Kindle you received and placing another order.  Returned and will buy again. Received word from Amazon that they are fixing the technical issues and to update next month.  Very impressed.

    Great device!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite last week during ‚ÄúPrime Day‚Äù; good price discount, got it for $88. The device is for my husband, he is an avid and voracious reader! I use my iPad to read ‚Äúkindle‚Äù books. My husband uses his iPhone ‚Äúkindle‚Äù app (the battery life is not good on iPhones, and reading books drains them even faster). So, we thought Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect solution. We were right!! Seemless integration with our library‚Äôs ‚ÄúLibby‚Äù app - books are delivered immediately to Kindle! Also, any books bought/borrowed (kindle unlimited) from Amazon is also immediately available on Kindle to read. We only have one account on Amazon, however our reading choices vastly differ. The library ‚Äúgrouping/collection ‚Äú option makes it super easy for my husband to access his books without having to scroll through my reading list. The screen is a perfect size, the device is very lightweight. He loves the screen brightness/intensity option too! Plus, the warm light option is great on the eyes for late night reading. Overall, he is very pleased with the device performance and happy I made the purchase.

    I had a Fire tablet that was slow and the Kindle app just does not do dark mode on it. The Kindle Paperwhite, however, does dark mode! I can read at night til I fall asleep without headaches. Before I would try to read and couldn't stand the light for more than 20mins. Now I am bumbling around finding all sorts of books. This has also prevented me from watching TV until I fall asleep. Now I read to fall asleep. This is SO light. I love that I could take this anywhere. I love real books, the smell of pages w/ink and all but when you already have a million things to travel with, this just simplifies it.Trade in your old Kindle/Fire tablet and get this one with Dark Mode and you'll find yourself reading more.

    Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) ‚Äì Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light ‚Äì Ad-Supported
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased my first Amazon Kindle Paperwhite in this bundle deal. I did not need the extra charging block but it's essentially free when purchased with the bundle, so why not?This is my first experience with any Amazon Kindle. I have recently taken up reading again and was beginning to accumulate a collection of physical books so I opted to go paperless instead. I chose this Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) with 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light, Ad-Supported; along with the Kindle Paperwhite Fabric Cover (11th Generation-2021) in Deep Sea Blue.I read in the evenings while laying in bed with my head and shoulders slightly propped up on a pillow. I have the brightness turned all the way down on the Kindle and the adjustable warm light to almost as ""yellow"" as it will go. I also wear blue-light blocking glasses. I have NOT noticed any negative impacts on my eyes or sleep schedule due to the light from reading on this Kindle. The overall Kindle and case together are very lightweight and easy to use. The Kindle screen automatically turns off/on when the case opens/closes. My hands, wrists, arms do not ache or get tired when reading for ~30+ minutes.The battery life so far is beyond exceptional. When I first received my Kindle, I fully charged it and set it aside for 2 MONTHS while I finished reading the remaining physical books I had already purchased. When I picked up the Kindle, after it had been sitting for 2 months, the battery was still at 80%.I am still learning the little tricks and settings within the Kindle as far as turning off page numbers, percent complete, estimated times, and overall page layout, font, size, etc. I am still toying with the highlighting and other reference/resource features. But overall, the functionality is very intuitive. I have NOT needed to Google any instructions on how to change something yet... I originally contemplated spending the extra money for the version without ads but decided against it, which now I would recommend. The Ads don't bother me at all and only seem to appear on the lock screen.I thought I would miss physical books and put off buying a Kindle for far too long. This Kindle is so much more convenient, light weight, travels easy, and you don't get distracted with notifications (as you might with a ""regular"" tablet). I would highly recommend a Kindle to any avid reader.

    So, to begin, I got my kindle as a Christmas present.  All was going well with that one until sometime in April when it crashed and it was constantly trying to reboot and restart.The customer service was awesome and sent me a replacement.  (Knock on wood) I haven‚Äôt had any issues with this new one and it‚Äôs July now.Overall, I love this thing, especially with a KU subscription.  It makes it easy to read, anywhere, at any time of day.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this is supposed to have up to 10 weeks of battery life, mine only lasts about 2-3 weeks if I‚Äôm reading exclusively on my kindle for long periods of time.  This doesn‚Äôt really bother me, but the 10 weeks sounds more like a standby charge and not a use charge.I love that it‚Äôs got the option to make the screen tone an orange hue, which is ideal for night time reading.  It‚Äôs also waterproof so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it getting wet if I‚Äôm reading while taking a relaxing bath or lounging by the pool.Overall, this is an awesome device and it‚Äôs really helping my rewarding goal (I‚Äôm at 28/50 so far!)

    Not as good as my previous Kindle Voyage
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve read about 10 books on this Kindle and have come to this conclusion: the Kindle Paperwhite (PW) is a step down from my Kindle Voyage so I am returning it. If you‚Äôve never used the Voyage, then you will probably love the PW. It is easy to read and the operating system has some nice features that my Voyage does‚Äôt. The screen is a slightly larger which most users will see as an advantage. However, it seemed huge to me at first because I was used to a smaller screen.On the PW, you press the page on the right side to turn to the next page, and press it on the left side to return to the previous page. On the Voyage, you can press either side to move forward or backward, which is great if you hold the Kindle with your left had while reading, as I do. On the PW, when holding it with your left hand, you must tap the screen with your right hand or stretch your thumb across the screen to tap it.The response to tapping is still slow. As far as I can tell, there is no speed improvements since I bought my Voyager in 2016.One feature the new PW has is Audible integration. I‚Äôm an Audible junkie and enjoy the Whispersync technology. Sometimes I enjoy listening to a book while reading it on the Kindle. Unfortunately, if you use your PW to listen and want to read along, the PW ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù the words. It is very distracting and I could find no way to shut it off. Also, if you are listening while reading along, and you flip back a page to glance at something, the narration will jump to that page, which is frustrating. In addition, if you like to listen to Audible and 1.5x, the PW does a terrible job. All in all, I think it is best to avoid using this PW for audible.I purchased the bundle which included the case. The case is nothing to brag about. My Voyager case folds so the Kindle will be slightly slanted if you sit it on a table to read.Also, I see no reason to pay extra for additional memory. Kindle books take up very little memory and it is quick and easy to download them when you are connected to WiFi.If you‚Äôve never used a Kindle or only use to the low end Kindles, this is the Kindle for you. If you‚Äôre use to the Voyage, you will be disappointed.

    I very much enjoy reading and if i cant bring my real books everywhere reading them electronically without ""being on my phone"" is great. I feel like touch screen has a slight delay compared to my smart phone but its tolerable. I was a bit bummed that its completely colorless, meaning the book covers in the library are in black n white and the ""highlights"" aren't in color like the app. Switching from the app to the Kindle is a little bit to get used to because u change pages differently. Instead of swiping u have to tap right to go ahead and left to go back and tap top to get tbe menu. I wish there was an option to have it the same as the app.

    The Best Paperwhite Ever!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've owned Kindle e-readers since they first came out in 2007 and have lost count of how many models I've owned but all have been great.I read a lot, probably 20 or more hours a week, almost all on Kindle. The current 2021,11th generation, is by far the best I've used.The larger display makes a real difference and the touchscreen sensitivity and faster page turns are the most important differences to me but there are many other significant upgrades.It's absolutely worth buying at full price. However, I bought mine on Prime Day and traded in my 7th generation model. With the Prime Day discount, trade-in, etc., it cost less than $50 for the upgrade and I'm delighted.I've attached a side by side photo of the new 11th generation and my old 6th generation model. It's a huge improvement.

    I read in bed at night. You can adjust brightness (warmth) so you don't bother someone else trying to sleep & you can schedule when to switch from cool to warm and the warmth saturation itself.  I still find the controls  & scrolling a little clunky e. g. looking through library & I think I'm going to attach one of those phone knobs on the back so it's easier to hold to read. It's a little wide & slippery for my small hands. It's great for reading outside. I wish you could do the finger swipe (like I used to with Kindle app on my IPad) to turn pages instead of tapping on edge of screen. Update: it helps to read the user guide because it says I can swipe, & it gives more info on sorting libraries in ""family"" mode) It is too easy to skip pages if you are carrying it from one room to another so just switch it off. I do like when I can display the book I'm reading on front screen (ad free) but it's not really worth the extra $$ to get ad free option. The only ad you ever see is reading recommendations on your front screen when it's turned off. All in all it's a great product.

    this new kindle is replacing my old paperwhite from 2017. Love the dark mode. I use it in bed and fall asleep, so it goes into standby all night, so I wish it would power off after a set time to conserve battery even more. I don't like the way both paperwhites have to be powered off. You have to push and hold the button and wait for it to respond. It takes too long for me. I wish there were some kind of sliding switch that could be used for instant shutdown. Also, I wish there were more choices of oragami cases for sale. My first paperwhite kindle had lots of cases to choose from.  This kindle doesn't have as many choices and the pattern that I liked didn't work well because the magnets aren't strong enough to hold the stand in place.

    I had reservations about upgrading, and only did so because of the prime day deal and the trade-in offer.  I upgraded from the 2015 Paperwhite.  Due, partially to my previous/new case, the new, larger version is the same size in case.  Less than a millimeter on any side difference.  The screen is less grainy and slightly easier to read.  The battery life seems like it will last quite a bit longer.  Those would not have made the cost worth it.  What puts it over the top, the page transition and scrolling speed.  Changing pages on the new Paperwhite does seem truly instant.  Much faster to scroll through my library when I am not sure what I want to read next.  I turned off the ads with no issue.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Replaced an older version, with the page turn buttons along the edge.  This is ok, touchscreen, but have to be careful to not accidently touch the screen, like when reading in bed, and shift around.  Sometimes with an accidental touch there seems to be several pages turned or maybe a return to a chapter or some other location, and can take some searching to get back where I was.  And I will make the comment, at the total risk of having others tell me to RTFM...I have not found how to keep or change the footnote area that sometimes displays page number, or ""location"", or percentage read.  Seems to come and go and I have not found easily how to set this and keep it.  It would be nice to be able to return when I have mistakenly hit the screen and botched my reading.  Size is much better than previous, can actually carry in a pocket while not feeling near so restricted as trying to read on a stinking phone (letting my bias toward a phone being something other than a phone show through there, sorry.)  Big question...yes, I would buy again, but would prefer a model with physical buttons.  Battery life seems terrific, ample for even a longer camping outing.

    I used to own the original version Kindle digital reader (a looong time ago). I enjoyed it but got away from reading digital books. Watching videos on YouTube and asking a coworker, I decided to try again since I've found that reading digital books on my iPad can be cumbersome because it is heavy and can cause eye strain.The Kindle Paperwhite is light, easy on the eyes, and much easier to use than its original version. The setup was really easy since I already have an Amazon Echo set up to my wifi, all I really had to do was turn it on and confirm that it goes with my Amazon account. It connected automatically to my wifi and I was all set up.I like that I can also read library books on the Kindle and that previous books I purchased were still there and available to read. Now, I might be able to catch up on my reading. Ha! I like the warm light setting and the page turn feature that makes it look like you are turning pages when you tap the screen to advance to the next page.I do hope that Amazon adds more fonts in the future, like the new ""bionic"" font that helps you read and supposedly retain more of what you read.

    My 2nd Kindle and a definite upgrade!

    I got this Kindle during a special deal and have been enjoying the bigger screen surface, better touch options, more intuitive directions and design pretty much every morning and often in the evening. Don't know why I waited YEARS to get a Kindle. They are very handy. This Kindle's brightness is easily dialed down and a softer light prevails.

    Not enough options
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my Kindles, I have three. Two are the Paperwhites. This is the newer model and there's a couple things that seriously bother me. First is you can't set a screen timeout limit and second you can't stop the screen from locking once it starts to lock. I know it's the basic model but these should be standard options. I still love it though.

    Power button placement is annoying
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I just finished my first book on this new Kindle Paperwhite and I‚Äôm loving that I can go into my backyard and read it in full sun so clearly! However, I agree with many users who‚Äôve mentioned the power button at the bottom. Whoever came up with that design should be demoted. If you look at the way you hold any device then your pinky finger is probably propping up the bottom of it. If you‚Äôre right handed, that pinky finger hits right where the power button is. I‚Äôm constantly turning it off. I told myself, when reading other reviews on this issue, that I wouldn‚Äôt do that and bought it because it was Prime Day. Ugh! I‚Äôm annoyed every ten minutes because I ALWAYS do it. Taking away one star for this design flaw.

    This generation provides a much more responsive experience (power on/off, page turn, browsing in general), and the increase in screen size makes it a modern-looking device and the improve in reading experience is significant. Highly recommend to own or to upgrade!

    I am  having a bit of buyer's remorse with this.  I had been thinking of getting a new Kindle just because mine was old but then I started having connection problems. I was on chat & the phone for HOURS & no one could figure out what the problem was. Finally I was told it was just old, it hadn't even updated in nearly a year, & I probably should just get a new one which I did since I'd been thinking about it anyway.  When it arrived it wouldn't connect either.  I brought them both to the library &  both connected.  It turned out it was something weird w/ my ISP  not the Kindle at all.  But I decided to keep the new one & gave the old one away.  Now I wish I hadn't.  This one is a bit bigger,  is more square & feels a bit awkward to hold since I don't want to bend  back the cover like I did on my old one which cracked it along the fold.  I wish the settings we could choose from were all in one place rather than scattered around. I am not real tech savvy & think they are hard to find.  I don't care what other people highlight in books & I for sure don't know why anything is highlighted in a novel but I looked all over & couldn't find how to turn that off.  I contacted chat & they eventually told me it was on the font Aa page under 'more'.  I have trouble getting to the things I want & don't know  how to get back to a page.  I just got a new book & it didn't even go to the Kindle even tho that's what I selected.  I had to get it from my  Amazon page w/ all my books on it. The ones that were new on the  old Kindle are not labeled as such on that page so  now I don't know what I haven't read & what have only been removed from the device. I get books on special offer so sometimes I have them quite a while before I get to them. I really hate that warm, amber light!  I turned it on accidentally then it took a bit to find out to turn it off but I was able to lower it to zero so that shouldn't be a problem any more.  I suppose it's just a matter of getting used to where things are, like learning a new comp,  but that isn't a pleasant process. I do think it could be a little more user friendly for those of us who are technologically challenged.  I also wish there was a general tech support category for chat.  I've had to click on something that didn't apply to get help but everyone I have talked to has been fantastic.  I hope I cheer up about it now that I have it but right now I really miss my old one.

    My husband gave me my first Kindle Keyboard over 10 years ago.  I LOVED IT!  When I started getting the notices about the changes and what it would no longer be able to do I said OK, time to upgrade.  After comparing and reading reviews I decided to get the Paperwhite.  I do like the touchscreen and the built in light. Its easy to read. BUT I DO NOT LIKE how it has the library!! Its too hard to navigate, my ""READ"" books take up space. It was so easy to look at the unread books list on my old Kindle and move my read books to collections.  Not so much with the Paperwhite.  That is my biggest complaint with the device.  If they could change it to look like the old Kindle, I would be a happy camper.

    I love the way I can adjust the font size so that when my eyes are tired, I can still read. This eliminates the what to do with all the paperbacks after I read them problem too. I carry it every where as you never know when you might get a chance to read a chapter or two.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My husband has always been the avid reader in the family. I had always been to busy to get caught up in it....but for some reason, I kept getting lured in to making this purchase. It felt a bit frivious to me at first to make this purchase, since I never really read that much. My husband kept pointing out....I could use my tablet to read......but for some reason I was really drawn to the idea of owning a Kindle Paperwhite. At Christmas, I received a gift card and I thought, ""Ok, now is my time to take the plunge and make this purchase."" I made the purchase and have not regretted it one bit. I have become a reading addict in these few short months. I have flown through about 30 books so far. I love my Kindle Paperwhite so much, that I don't even pick up my tablet anymore.  I no longer waste my free time playing mindless games or watchin videos on my tablet, I just want to read the next great find on my Kindle. I LOVE the antiglare screen of the Kindle. Before I purchased this, I was afraid that I would not like the smaller size of the screen, but honestly, since owning the device it has not been a concern. The battery life is amazing. Easy to navigate. Lighter to hold and prop up when reading in bed. The glow of the screen makes it easy to read in the dark, but doesn't emit the blue light that interrupts sleep cycles. Purchasing the Kindle Paperwhite has brought me so much joy. It was definitely one of my best purchases. If you are on the fence and trying to rationalize that you don't need to spend the money because you have a tablet that you can use, just take the leap. I am glad that I did. I definitely prefer reading on it versus another device!

    I absolutely love this latest Paperwhite. The bigger screen offers a seamlessly pleasant experience, with the Sepia setting my favorite, as I find it the most pleasant in the eyes.But the feature that has me the happiest is the battery life. I received it nearly an entire month ago, and have purposefully not charged it past the first 100% which I did it the very first day, and after reading quite a bit every single day I've had it, and it's still at 9%!!!Outstanding!!! Couldn't be happier!!! üòä

    My wife is a voracious reader, which is why she has been a Kindle fan since they first came out (remember the QWERTY pushbutton days?).  The battery had really gone down after years of use on her older version (maybe bought 5-6 years ago), and it was time for an upgrade.  This version, despite a much bigger screen, is MUCH lighter, which is great for her as she often reads before bedtime.I bought it on sale for $98, and she's thrilled.  Of course, that makes me a happy hubby.

    I had to buy a Bluetooth speaker for read aloud when I‚Äôm cleaning or busy doing something else since it has no speaker built in. Kindle messed up leaving off this feature. Luckily I also have an old paper white that has speaker. Scared it will die or I will drop it!  This is my back up. Over almost twelve years I have become attached to read aloud with six Kindles. They don‚Äôt like being dropped on the floor without a cover!  I know can understand Microsoft mispronunciation!

    I prefer the Kobo Clara HD
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Love:-Temperature adjustment (although this is also available on the Kobo Clara HD)-I can send most titles from Libby to Kindle from my multiple library accounts, although it takes an extra step-Dark mode - most comfortable for reading in‚Ä¶darknessDislikes:-I miss the bezeled screen. It‚Äôs too easy to accidentally turn a page.-The screen feels harder to read on than the Clara HD. It seems less matte and requires more eye-straining illumination to read comfortably in the same light as the Clara HD.-I wish it were smaller. The Clara HD is the perfect size for me and my small hands. Add a flip cover to the Paperwhite and it feels just a bit too unwieldy, heavy, and unbalanced in my hand. I thus prefer reading it ‚Äúnaked,‚Äù with a clip on grip, but that requires a larger travel sleeve that is significantly less compact than the Clara HD, which literally fits my jacket or rear pants pocket.-Ads. Every time I look at them when I go to pick it up, I am filled with disgust. I am unfortunately even more indignant about *paying* to remove that feeling, so here I am.-Fingerprints. Ew. I am not a dirty person and I swear I wash my hands frequently, but you wouldn‚Äôt think that by looking at my Kindle. If it came in white, it would probably be significantly less noticeable.-Lack of font options. I know I can sideload more, but why must I have to do it to get any kind of variety?If I could get the Clara HD to sync both my library cards on my overdrive account at the same time, I‚Äôd be using that instead of the Paperwhite. It‚Äôs a significantly better value for your money, more pocketable, more pleasurable to read on and handle, faster, and if you like free books, easier to use with a  *single* library account (in the US). The moment Kobo streamlines Overdrive and you can have more than one library to toggle between, I will definitely be saying goodbye to Kindle, as I own very, very few Kindle titles and borrow most of my books. If you‚Äôre already heavily invested in Kindle‚Äôs ecosystem, I am truly sorry.

    Perfect size. I have been reading from my iPhone which is a mini so the bigger screen is a plus. I used to have a kindle fire but didn‚Äôt use the other features. So this is great to have something basic to read from. Only negative wish it was in color as well since I read magazines from it as well. I could just be missing the button to select color though. I have only had it for a week and haven‚Äôt really explored all the features.

The operating system has taken me some time to get used to due to being an Apple person but I‚Äôm getting a hang of it.I debated getting this one or the one without ads but the shipment date for no ads was about 3 months out. After I bought the regular one, someone showed me how to disable ads for $20 through the Amazon Desktop site so the Lock Screen ads don‚Äôt drive me insane.

    Great device, poor quality control (dead pixel)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I wish I could give the 6.8‚Äù Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen 2021) 5 stars. It‚Äôs a beautiful, snappy device with a bright, clear large screen. Unfortunately, poor quality control makes this almost perfect device, not so perfect.Purchased: 27 November 2021Review written: 30 November 20211. ResponsivenessScreen is very responsive and snappy. There‚Äôs not much load time when scrolling, selecting, or page turning.2. SoftwareNice user interface. Very easy to use, especially to transfer over library books. There were some issues when opened out of the box, but a reset fixed the issues.3. Battery/chargeUSB-C may be a winner for some. I have no opinion.4. Quality ControlKindle is known for having hit or miss quality control. The new 2021 Paperwhite is no different. For me, my Paperwhite has tiny pinhole light also known as a dead pixel. E-readers are prone to this issue so it‚Äôs not a surprise, BUT a defect is a defect regardless. Quality control should have found this issue so it doesn‚Äôt fall into the hands of customers.The pinhole is negligible but it is annoying when my eyes stray towards the small light hole. Plus, I paid for a defect-free new device.5. Amazon Customer ServiceAmazon online CS used to be unparallel, second to none. I contacted Amazon online CS about the pinhole light and I was willing to send pictures of the issue. I expected to be sent a new replacement device. Some unlucky customers have to go through 2-3 devices before they find a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù device free of defects/issues. I went into buying the Kindle knowing this.The best Amazon online CS could offer was to replace my defected device with a certified refurbished device delivered 2-3 days. I asked if a new device could be sent out, CS said no. I asked if I could exchange for another device in store, Amazon CS said no.I called the Amazon store and the supervisor told me that I can return my device and buy a new device. They will do a price adjustment for me so I pay the same price as I did during Thanksgiving weekend. That was a nice offer‚Ä¶ except it makes the process for a new device inconvenient.Anyhoo, approach Kindle with some caution. It‚Äôs not a flawless device. It has the potential to be, though. I‚Äôm going to try to ignore the dead pixel as I read before I get a chance to return it for a (hopefully) defect free device.UPDATED REVIEW - January 6, 2022I returned the defective Kindle unit at the Amazon 4Star and purchased a new Kindle unit. The Amazon employee did a price adjustment for me so it matched sale price from my original purchase. Right from the box, the new Kindle unit has a very small black dot at the top right of the screen - very minor cosmetic issue.  Another dead pixel. This defect is not noticeable compare to the white light  spot (pinhole light/dead pixel(s) as the returned Kindle unit.I expected this. A few lucky Kindle users get Kindles with flawless screens. Some customers have to return/exchange 3-4x to get a perfect unit. Since the cosmetic issue is so minuscule, I accept it. The new unit has an almost perfect screen.Customer service at the Amazon 4Star store is above average.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Much has been said about the Paperwhite, here‚Äôs my two cents:Positives: backlight works great, warmth option is really nice, adjustable brightness is fantastic, very lightweight, easy to hold.Negatives: the computer processor is very slow, which is crazy for a modern device of any kind. Browsing for books is so slow and the screen takes a long time to refresh. Best to browse on Amazon.com directly and buy books from there, don‚Äôt bother doing it on the Kindle itself unless you have hours to do it. This is absolutely NOT a replacement for an iPad or tablet - not even close.Overall: Reading is GREAT. Web browsing is very bad. Backlight and warmth options are excellent. Worth the buy but you will need to have your laptop or phone nearby to complete any tasks except reading a book. Fair trade on that issue given the low price and extensive Amazon book catalog.

    I always love the Kindle E-readers and this is about my sixth one. However, I noticed the charging port is not the standard one but requires  the charging cable that comes with the Kindle or an adapter for a standard cable. Why? Now if I travel I have to bring along a special cable to charge my Kindle instead of one that charges everything. Also the on/off button would work better on the top of the Kindle because when I rest the Kindle on my legs it sometimes turns it off.

    I liked the Kindle, its really great and the screen is amazing for reading.However, the lock button which is at bottom is a stupidest thing these people have done, could have just given the lock button at the top. The lock button at the bottom gets clicked while holding the kindle, or when you place the kindle standing up straight resting on something. This button unnecessarily irritates while reading.

However, it is faster on page turns, increased capacity, and the lighting is much nicer.  I like the 2 different light adjustments, it makes it nice when reading at night and you don't want the bright white light.  I do also like the slightly larger screen size.  Overall a nice upgrade.

    I really enjoy this Kindle with the adjustable bright backlight! I use to have an old kindle that I used at night with another clip on light. The light would keep me up at night. If you were considering upgrading your old kindle, this is the one to buy!

    i stopped reading for a while bc the only time i ever really have is at night , but my boyfriend will be asleep and not want the lights on so this is the perfect compromise . plus if we go somewhere at night i can read without the light bothering him , unlike with my paperbacks .my only critic is that it's kinda slow when i'm on the homepage or making comments/highlighting within books which i wouldn't expect from a brand new device but maybe that's just kindle ? it's perfect when actually reading so i'm not too bothered by it .

    My mom has an older Kindle Fire that she loves, but she had mentioned that she didn't like that she had to have a light on to read at night.  In comes the Paperwhite; since it's backlighted no light is needed to read!  It also has better battery life than her other Kindle and she loves the slim silhouette!  Perfect birthday present.

    Bigger Screen, Better Battery Life
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Background:  Prior to this model, I was using the Kindle Oasis which had a terrible battery life. I much prefer the Kindle Oasis form factor, however just 1 year of use, the batter life issue became a major hinderance. I was having to recharge once or twice a day! I read using my Kindle for hours daily and I was not expecting to have such battery issues! After a year with such terrible battery performance, AND seeing the new Kindle Paperwhite came with updated USB-C, I decided it was worth it to purchase the new model.Pros:The Battery Life is improved over my Kindle Oasis - like a HUGE change for the better. I can go days without charging! Also, USB-C charging is so much better than micro!Screen: I like the size of the screen and appreciate the addition of the warmth setting! The backlighting is also excellent.Cons:Form Factor: My preference is for the Oasis - having two page-turning buttons. Also, it just felt good to hold. This model Kindle Paperwhite does not fit in my hand as well as the Oasis did. I dislike how the screen is not centered, the margin below the screen, with the KINDLE branding makes this device feel off-balance.I hope to someday come back to the Kindle Oasis, until then, the Kindle Paperwhite is an excellent e-reader for most readers with a long-lasting battery and other additions that make reading an absorbing experience.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    When I saw the size (small) I did not think I would like this reader, but was intent on giving it a few weeks before returning...but the surprise is I actually LOVE this reader!  Have grown accustomed to the compact size, well lit, nice font sizing, and screen touch is acceptable.  Overall, a quality reader at not a lot of money.Still not sold on the Amazon additional service ($10/month for unlimited books), finding that most of the books I want to read are not included in the collection, and likely will end up having to buy Kindle version for download.Also, the covers they pair with the reader are way overpriced.  The cork one was a bust.  Found one made by OOC and LOVED it, at $17.

    My previous Kindle Paperwhite was only holding a charge for a few days and it was looking kind of beat up, so I decided it was time to upgrade. Here are the pros and cons compared to the previous model:Pros:* Lightweight* Larger screen* Better screen: the older model had dark areas at the top and bottom of the screen* No stuck pixels: the older model had three stuck pixels that bugged me* Waterproof (I could care less about this)Cons:* The wider form factor makes it more difficult to hold, especially if you have small hands* The border is now part of the screen, so if you touch it, it will leave smudges* Because the border is part of the screen, if you touch the left or right border, it will take you back or forward a page. This is the worst thing about this Kindle. I often find myself on the wrong page because I touched the border. I'll have to train myself to keep my fingers off the front of the device. Whether I'll be successful remains to be seen.Bottom line: I like this Kindle Paperwhite. I would like it more if the designers had made it so touching the black border didn't turn the page. Keep a microfiber cloth handy and try not to touch the border and you'll be ok.

    Have only been using a week, but so far, so good. The warm light definitely takes some getting used to, but easily adjustable. Love the larger screen, but as others have said, it is easier to accidentally advance the page due to the slimmer bezel.  I purchased to replace a 2014 model (yes, 2014 that had only recently started acting a bit sluggish) and looking forward to another several years of enjoyment.  You will definitely need to purchase a cover (it's a bit slippery without) and honestly, the open to wake feature is awesome!

My friend scared me that I would not be able to download books through the computer. All this is fiction. Very convenient, I copied my files, like on a USB flash drive. The process takes a couple of minutes. I also really love this particular model for waterproof, I take it with me to the bath and I don‚Äôt worry that I will drop it into the water. The battery with WiFi turned off lasts about a month. When buying, I misunderstood the functionality of audible, I thought that the robot would read books aloud to me. Well, you never know how technology has evolved. Of course, I was wrong. But this in no way prevents me from sincerely loving my kindle üòä

    The Paperwhite was easy to set up and once I remembered to tap the screen to get the home/settings icons to appear at the top, I was fine (and no longer got stuck on certain screens).I like the font setting, the adjustable brightness, and the warm-light option. I also like the light weight when compared to my prior Kindle (a much, much older model).I've had it for seven weeks now and charged it once only because I wanted to test the adapter. Charged it at 60-some percent maybe over a month ago and it still has 55% now (I don't use it daily). There's no problem reading on it while it is charging.Very happy with this product.

    Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.- was a welcome upgrade over 10th Gen. ... but I had to try it to be convinced...Here's what I like:- e-Ink screen still best in sunlight, outdoor reading- screen is noticeably larger than last 10th gen. device c.2019- about 1/4"" higher and wider, but still fits in jeans pockets - carry anywhere!- new backlight option includes variable warm tone- waterproof- light weight - 200 grams - easier to hold for long reading sessions- added USB-C charge connection (finally, last of my devices to drop micro-USB)- overall noticeably faster - screen changes, swipes and on-screen keyboard typing- same $139 price-point for 8GB (plenty of space)- On device shopping and purchasing of eBooks (can't do on iPad App)- hands-down best choice for outdoor reading - see photo- battery life is excellent, can even be a solar powered Kindle with this 14watt panel - see photoSame design challenges that still needs work...- audio through Bluetooth, connecting and getting screen reader to speak is WAY too many taps (software changes needed! - PLEASE!)- wish power button was on the TOP edge, not the bottom edge - or make it recessed - often setting device down turns off- could still be a tiny bit faster, but this is first one that speed is acceptableOverall a great eReader that keeps getting better!

    Big improvement over my Kindle Voyage
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I fell for the hype of buying the ""premium"" Kindle Voyage when it was first released.  Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome Kindle but was quickly outclassed by the Kindle Oasis and the new, at the time, Kindle Paperwhite.  Anyway, I love my Voyage but when I heard about the new Kindle with the bigger screen, I had to have it.  It arrived yesterday and I'm really liking it.First, the things I don't like.- The Kindle arrived in a soft bubble shipping bag and the Kindle itself comes in a very thin, and for me, crushed, cardboard box.  I was afraid the screen was going to be broken but luckily for me, it was fine.- I don't like the power button being on the bottom.  The Voyage has the power button on the back and out of the way.  I've pressed the power button on the Paperwhite twice now by accident.- Another thing I don't like...and don't understand...is that I charged the Paperwhite overnight and it only charged to 99%.  My Kindle Voyage will only charge to 98%, even when it was brand new.  Is that a thing with Kindles; they don't charge to 100%?- The Paperwhite was supposed to arrive already tied to my account but it wasn't.  It wasn't hard to set up but it didn't transfer my library to the Paperwhite automatically.  Should it have?  From my PC, I transferred my library to the Paperwhite from the Digital Content management page.  That was a pain in the butt because you can only transfer the books 1 page at a time and my library is 34 pages long.  And you can't sort the books by whether they had been read or not, so I had to uncheck all the books I had already read so they wouldn't be transferred to the Paperwhite. Not to mention that not all of my read books were listed as being read so I had to sort that out too.  It took a long time to transfer my library. Ugh!Second, the things I do like.- Everything else!!- I love the larger screen. The extra screen real estate, compared to my Voyage, is awesome.- The Paperwhite is a lot faster than the Voyage in navigation, page turns, everything.- I'm glad it has a USB-C port, which will cut down on the number of cables I have to keep track of.- So far, I don't miss the physical buttons that the Voyage has...but I've only had the Paperwhite for a day so that may change with more use.I haven't played around with the lighting yet so I can't speak to that.My new Paperwhite got 2 software updates yesterday.  After the second one it froze and I had to restart it.  After that it was fine.So far, I'm really pleased with the new 2021 Paperwhite and I think it is a great upgrade from my Voyage.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had two kindles in my whole life and had to give them up, but I've been looking to get a Kindle for a while. I haven't had the funds to get one and have been content with my phone, until I upgraded phones and was forced to borrow books from KU by computer only.I chatted with Amazon Kindle support for a solution, so I could borrow books on my phone, but it seemed there was no solution. I didn't have my previous phone, so I couldn't just revert back to that. I tried multiple times to borrow a book, and it would say I borrowed it, but wouldn't show up in my library. Weeks after my chat with Amazon support, I heard there was a Kindle sale, so I bought the latest Paperwhite in hopes I would have access to KU.I ordered the 8gb version, and was excited to finally have a Kindle again. I received the device a week earlier than expected and immediately after set up, there wereproblems left and right. Right away, the device was continuously freezing and glitching. As I was trying to download books, it was deciding to restart itself for a total of three times and reset my download progress each time. Over the course of three days, I finally got all my books downloaded, but yet the device was still freezing and restarting itself.One day, though, the Kindle was close to being dead, so I decided to preserve the battery and not read until I could get it charged. After putting it on the charger, I went to read and it immediately froze.. again. This time, I couldn't do anything with it. It wasn't dead when I put it on the charger, it was working just fine before, but nothing was happening. I was trying to power it off and on, but it still wasn't working. I Googled the problem and came across directions for a soft restart, which I did. Upon restart, it wouldn't get past the kid and the tree screen, no matter what I did. Eventually I just gave up and left it there for an hour on that screen. It finally got past it, but the device was still glitching and freezing continuously three days later.Besides those problems, I'm also not impressed with the battery life. After a day of reading with it being fully charged, it drops to 20-30% remaining. It defeats the purpose of having a Kindle, when it has to remain on the charger at all times. Recently it's been more so on the charger than not.With the amount of problems I've been having, it's strange there's not much out there about them. This is a brand new Kindle, but with the amount of problems I've been having, you'd think it'd be the first generation. I don't know what to do with it. I want a Kindle so I can finally use my KU, but is the multiple problems worth it? I've been thinking a lot about possibly returning it and trying the signature edition, but what if it's the exact same? I don't know what to do. I'm not at all satisfied with this generation and I'm hoping something will change, like an update and it'll be usable again, but that might be too much to hope for at this point.

    This is my third Paperwhite and I honestly exited it to be better than my old on. It freezes up - a lot, easily as much as my first one does today and I bought that one in 2014.  I do love that when you put something in a collection it no longer shows in the main library.  I wasn‚Äôt offered a trade in when I ordered it so I paid full price.  What a piece of crap.  You read along and suddenly it goes forward a couple of pages, yesterday it would not let me go back.

    From 10th Generation to 11th Generation
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I recently upgraded from the 10th Gen Kindle Paperwhite to the 11th Gen Kindle Paperwhite and the difference is pretty noticeable, though there are still areas for improvement.For the most part, reviewing the Kindle for my purposes is pretty much the same as reviewing the function of a physical book. Is it damaged? No. Can it be easily read? Yes. Ok, then it's good to go.In truth, that's really the two most important things for me when deciding whether or not the Kindle was a good buy, and frankly, I could have stuck with my old Kindle and probably only very seldom got frustrated with it.One thing I believe Amazon needs to work on with their Kindle is their UI. I understand that this is not a cell phone, a laptop, or a tablet. It's an e-reader, and at the end of the day, most of your time is spent reading books. And for that, the UI is totally fine. But for those times when you're scrolling the store, looking through your library of too many books purchased, or just navigating settings, the UI can be frustratingly laggy and jumpy. The response time is slow, the touchscreen is relatively inconsistent, and the loading time looks like my dial-up computer trying to bring up a black and white webpage in 1998. Again- it's an e-reader and I'm not online shopping on it, but I have to feel that in 2022, this UI could be much smoother and more responsive.With that said, this is leaps and bounds better than my 10th Gen, which would regularly revert back to the previous screen when trying to load a new one, would flash a new screen 2-3 times before finally allowing me to continue navigating, and would shut down to the main screen intermittently. None of these were deal-breakers, but the 11th Gen is definitely smoother in that regard.Overall, I love this device. The larger screen from the 10th Gen to the 11th Gen is nice and it doesn't came with a significantly larger package. It's sleek and the screen is a nice adjustable shade when I read. I am very pleased with my purchase.

    Why doesn‚Äôt Amazon sell its own Kindle charging cord?
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve had a Kindle since the second version came out.  I thought I‚Äôd hate e-readers and refused to buy one until I was on vacation and went through all of the books I‚Äôd brought with half my trip left.  So I ordered one and it was delivered the next day.  I love them.When my Kindle Voyager (purchased in 2015) finally died, I was happy to get the new one largely due to the water resistant feature.  My prior Kindles have all survived accidental drops in the bath tub, but having one that is designed for it is a relief.This is my best Kindle yet.  The warm screen feature that allows me to set automatic changes based on my local sunrise and sunset is great.  The screen is even more clear.  It weighs less and without measuring it, I think the screen is slightly larger.  The basic memory is larger than my old one and I wasn‚Äôt even close to using all of that up with the over 1,500 books that I own on it.  I remain a devoted Kindle fan.My one complaint - the new charging cord is different than the old one.  Fine, no big deal.  I went online to order extra ones since I keep spares in my luggage, briefcase, etc.  (I pretty much don‚Äôt leave home without my Kindle.)  The third-party  cords that pop up on Amazon have largely poor reviews.  Which begs the question - why can‚Äôt I buy the exact cord that Amazon sent along with my new Kindle from Amazon?  They are having them manufactured.  Everyone needs more than one charging cord for their devices.  Amazon makes the wall plug in available, but not the cord.Come on, this seems like an easy fix.

    I loved this kindle.  I got it as a gift for this past Christmas.  My teething puppy chewed it up soooo bad and now it doesn't work, and it left a gaping hole in my heart.  EVERYTHING about this kindle i loved, coming from a nook which are laughable in comparison.  The speed was snappy, it never really got hung up no matter how many books i had on there, even side loaded ones.  The warm light was literally life when reading in bed at night.  It predicts how long it will take you to finish your current chapter which was also awesome.I wish so bad she didnt do it, but alas.  I am now stuck in sans-kindle land and i couldn't be more......sad.  For now, back to just reading on my ipad and shredding my eyeballs while doing it *sigh*

    Don‚Äôt laugh at me, but I just upgraded from the Kindle keyboard that I bought back in 2010. It still works perfectly and I love it, but it‚Äôs not backlit and I‚Äôm tired of the grey screen. I had the option of trading it in, but I‚Äôm keeping it as a backup.Anyway, I received my new Kindle yesterday and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect! The size, the white screen, the back light; it‚Äôs all perfect. I bought the leather case as well and am pleased with it too. If this new Kindle Paperwhite lasts as long as my Kindle Keyboard, we‚Äôll be in business.

    I purchased the paperwhite after using my Galaxy tab to read but it was so heavy. I love that it is water proof so reading at the pool or bath isn't an issue if it gets wet. The light weight feel is perfect for reading. I wish I had bought one sooner.

    When you wake your book up you will have to swipe it to get to your library.Don't delete any books that you paid for because if you will have to pay for them again if you decide to reread them.The screen is bigger so you get more reading space for your buck.Enjoy everyone.

    Read more now than before
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Before I got my Paperwhite, I read maybe one or two books a year. In the last two months since I bought my Paperwhite I have finished 18 books. I love that I can adjust the brightness to read in bed and not get a headache. I can read inside, outside, and haven't had any issue. I have had it just over two months and I have only put it on the charger it 4 times, and I read multiple hours a day. I haven't had to tested the waterproof feature yet. But having kids I'm thankful that that is an option.In the begining, first two weeks I did have a few issues where when I would try to load the store/ recommended books (to buy a book) the screen would go blank. After I did a hard reboot I had less issues. Then I had to do a hard reboot a second time a week later and haven't had any further issues with that feature.

    I am happy with Kindle.  Size is great.  The touch is very sensitive and sometimes turns more than one page but I think as I learn how much pressure to use it will get better.  Library is set up in more than one choice depending upon what you are looking for or which style you prefer.  Lighting can be adjusted.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.

    Better & Less Stable
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Definitely the best Kindle I've ever owned. The reading experience is much improved over my 2015 version. And Audible with Bluetooth rocks.One obvious downside though seems to be increased instability. It occasionally ignores touches, cannot connect, requires reboot, etc. Nothing terrible, but noticeable compared to the previous versions.

    Great Kindle with one annoying flaw
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my new Paperwhite - replaced a 5 year old Oasis whose battery was shot - great screen, size, etc... I like the larger screen on the Paperwhite than the Oasis, which was a bit small.Only one - very - annoying flaw. Apparently the screen can't be rotated on this version of the Paperwhite and the power button is on the bottom - and is very sensitive. So if you stand it on anything (for instance, a machine at the gym), the slightest jiggle will ""push"" the power button and cause the screen to reset. Super annoying - I've had to ""work around"" it by letting one side hang off the edge of the equipment.

    Great evolution in the Kindle lineup, but far from perfect.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought this a few days after they went on sale and overall I am very happy with the purchase.Screen Size: the upgrade in screen size is my favorite thing about this device, it makes reading much more pleasurable with fewer pages turns.I also love the waterproofing. My old Paperwhite did not have this and I love that I don't have to worry about it getting ruined at the pool, or more frequently, carrying to and from the car in a rainstorm.Is this a great device? Yes, it is a Kindle.Is this device perfect? Far from it...it's a Kindle. My main beef is the smaller bezel that every tech reviewer seems to go nuts about. I am constantly turning pages on accident because if you even imagine you're holding this thing with your thumb near the edge of the screen, the pages will turn. Amazon should add a feature that creates a user customizable dead zone on the edges so that accidental page turns are a thing of the past. This would rock my world. Or, you know, they could just make the bezels a little wider to make the device easier to handle.Another thing I cannot stand is the placement of the power button. Just resting the end of the device on a table and tilting it up is another to turn it off. This happens all the time. It also happens just holding the device...this power button would be better suited where it was on my older 2015 Paperwhite or, better yet, on top of the device, out of sight, out of mind.I am glad to see the direction they have taken this update. However, the OS is still laggy, the bezels and power button, due to the design, are FAR from optimal. I think they need to hand these out to employees during the design phase to do a LOT more testing before settling on the final design.But, who am I fooling? This device will sell like hotcakes so Amazon basically has no reason to listen to what any of us say. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but gave it 3 because these shortcomings do NOT make it a 4-star device.

    Best PaperWhite Yet
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had a Kindle since the Keyboard/K3 was released. I've had the voyage and a 2nd generation Oasis but I keep coming back to the PaperWhite it might lack a couple features the Oasis has with but now with the upgrade to the larger screen it's now just . 2 tenths of an inch smaller than the far more expensive Oasis. I enjoyed my 2nd gen. Oasis but when battery began to fail I went right back to a PaperWhite. It has all I need at the right price. I love the larger screen. The battery life is impressive. The PaperWhite has always been the best deal in Kindles and now it's even better.

    Nice improvement, bad device, good support
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had an earlier generation paperwhite -- I really like that the Kindle generates its own light... no more leaving a light to read by.This gen 11 screen is much smoother than my old one, and the improved CPU does make it seem more responsive... I liked it in every way.... except for two things:1) Most important, after about six weeks, the device locked up, and could not be restarted or reset. On the good side, Amazon provided stellar support and is shipping me a replacement.2) I have many of my books in collections and the last update of the software is HORRIBLE! When I choose to view my collections, you have NO CHOICE but a grid view, and many of the books don't have easily readable titles... I want a list view, but this cannot be done!  If I just look at all of the books (no collection view), the form can be selected, but not once I tell it to show the collections. This is TERRIBLE!!!I hope that they fix this quickly, for I have to resort to searching to find my books now, since many of the covers are not that readable.But the Kindle operating system is not really the point of this review.  Bottom line is that the device is a nice improvement. Even with the failure after a few weeks, I still like it.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôm testing out this kindle against the Kobo Libra 2.What I like about the Kindle:+ screen is good size and clarity+ it is adequately snappy+ syncs across devices+ functional note and highlighting, easily shareable+ the nigh shift is greatWhat I don‚Äôt like about the Kindle- I‚Äôll frequently tap the screen somewhere and pull up the menu or turn a page, not immediately clear if it goes forward or backwards- not immediately clear how to access brightness- - the power button is on the bottom of the device. I have more than once accidentally locked the screen just by propping the device up. This is a fireable offense by the lead engineer who championed this location. A monkey would choose a better placement than the bottom of the device‚Ä¶.- - - YOU CANNOT, I REPEAT, YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR READING WISH LIST ON THE KINDLE. That‚Äôs right, you added a book to your wishlist in your app? PC? Even kindle? Awesome! Yeah but you won‚Äôt see that on your kindle. Literally adding a book on the kindle to a wishlist is INACCESSIBLE. You have to ‚Äúdownload a sample‚Äù or use ‚ÄúGoodreads‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry but this is absolutely inexcusable. You have the store built in but no way to access the wishlist. What‚Äôs the point? Embarrassing. I will most likely return the device over these two glaring issues.

    This is my first Kindle. In fact it is the first time that I've ever seen a Kindle aside from the ads.I have been using the Kindle app on my tablet. The app is great but my tablet is slow and uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time (arthritis).What I like:This device is light as a feather.It performs quickly.It is easy to read and customize.The ads are not intrusive at all. I hadn't intended to buy the ad supported device and didn't know that an ad free device is available. I can easily live with the ads and, who knows, Amazon might even display ads for books I might likeWhat I'm not crazy about:Page refreshes are kind of clumsy. Page turns are okay but the dialog boxes cause the screen to go dark for an instant when the box closes. To me this seems rough around the edges.The screen sort of reminds me of the old liquid crystal displays found on Palm Pilots and similar devices back in the day.I was hoping to find that the Kindle app and the actual Kindle have the same navigation. They don't.What I'm hoping for:Long battery life.  I do most of my reading at night so the backlighting will always be on. I'm still fiddling with the brightness setting to find a sweet spot.Set up was easy. I was happy to find that my library is complete without any complications.

    I upgraded from an older model. The clarity is nice but I wish the text was a true black instead of a grey. It's probably just something to do with the way e-books are but it would be nice to have the text darker. I ordered a screen protector for it and ended up having to take it off because it was obfuscating/dulling the text even more. There is not a way to darken the text of the Kindle Paperwhite, I think if you get the more expensive version there is the capability of modifying/darkening the text but at 160$, I feel like it should also be available.

    Overall, this is a good Kindle. I like the ""warm"" screen; easy on the eyes. The lock screen however is buggy. Entering the unlock code is slow because the Kindle is slow to respond to key presses. I've found the solution  is to restart/reset the Kindle and after it restarts, then the lock screen works better---for a while, then it starts to slow again. Battery life is good and recharge time is very fast.

    The only thing that was holding me back from buying this earlier was that it had no color.

    I had the previous generation Paperwhite and I currently have the 2+ year old Oasis and bought  the new Paperwhite for its new features.I'm really impressed with the 6.8 screen size which looks just as big as my 7 inch Oasis.  Love the warm light feature and thin body. The Paperwhite""s battery lasts weeks and outlasts my Oasis!! I've always been disappointed by the battery life of the Oasis.The new Paperwhite still has that portability Factor where I can just throw it in my jacket pocket and read anywhere. It has a zippy performance and seems to be faster than my Oasis. The USBC cable means you I can use the same plug as my phone. I don't like the old USB on the Oasis. I don't need the Paperwhite plus with the extra features. 'm not a big fan of the automatic sensor which I have on the Oasis, and I usually shut off. For most people the basic Paperwhite will be just fine for daily reading. The only thing negative I can say is that the paperwhite does not have page turning buttons like the Oasis, which is a nice feature to have but I don't always use them.My picture shows the Oasis on the left and the new Paperwhite on the right.Amazon, excellent job on the new Kindle Paperwhite!!! It's a winner in my book.

    One day, I'd really like to get a Kobo, just for fun. But every time that it's time for an upgrade, I keep coming back to Kindle. The 20% discount when you trade in your old Kindle certainly helps! Even  so, it's easy enough to convert epubs that I bought from elsewhere and put them on my Paperwhite, so that's never been a factor for me.I had the last generation Paperwhite, and I did like it a lot. I upgraded because I was interested in the bigger screen, faster page turns and usb-c charging.The 20% faster page turns doesn't really seem like that big of a deal to me over the previous generation. If you have a regular Kindle or an older Paperwhite, I think you'll really notice it, though. The screen wake doesn't seem any faster than my last  Paperwhite; I think that could still use some improvement.The bigger screen and usb-c charging were definitely worth upgrading for me, though.

    it might be operator error but so far I am not a huge fan.  I had a 2010 Kindle and I remember the day I bought it.  The Home page was MY Home page without all the extra ads for book options.  I had it organized by folders/collections and once I finished a book, it went in the folder.  Any book yet to read was listed below the collections.In this new Kindle, I created a 'Collection' and thought I moved read books to it but they are still on the 'Home' page which has TMI.  Yes, there is a banner in the upper right corner marked read but I don't want to see the book anymore.  I want it tucked away to the folder nice and neat and organized.I do like the warm lighting.  I can read on the patio when the darkness falls which is great.  I don't like having to position my finger to touch screen scroll to the next page and the chaos of the Home page is awful.  It should not be called a Home page.  It is advertising galore with book recommendations I would not consider.  I want my old Kindle Home page - if anyone who does updates is listening can do.  And what is with the check marks?  I have to do a search to understand that.  I really, really don't like this Kindle.  I want to put a new battery in my old Kindle and get on with life.  I also hate that I cannot put a password other than numbers.  Are the Kindle creators listening?  And once you finish a book, good luck getting to the 'Home' page without going all the way to the end of the book.  I tried doing the pull down at the top, yea, frustrating.

    Great experience so far with my first e-reader.Have had it for a 3 weeks now and am loving this little kindle. The battery life is extraordinary in my opinion;  I have only needed to charge it once. The screen is very comfortable on my sensitive eyes and I like that it's easily adjustable in both brightness and warmth. The size is perfect for me since I wanted something larger than a phone but smaller than a tablet to read on. Very lightweight and portable.Amazon gives you 3months free of Kindle Unlimited to access books. But I find I'm using OverDrive more often through the public library to rent ebooks which are sent straight to my kindle. Perfect for on the go readers because you don't need to be on wi-fi to access your library.

The only reason I don't give it give stars is because it sometimes feels a little slow, specially when waking up. I understand that it my be because of the ink like technology; also when you're coming from a 120Hz smartphone, everything else might feel slow.

    Everything is awesome about this kindle except how you hold it. The screen is clear and turns fast. Library integration is an INCREDIBLE value. Love the warm backlight and the USB-C connection. The only problem is that the bevel is thin and the touch screen extends too far toward the edge of the screen, so it's hard to hold.If the 'margin' option affected how far in the touch screen recognized taps for page turning, this would be an automatic 5 stars. As it is, still 4.5 stars--absolutely worth the money.

    I've owned about 5 Kindles over the years. This one is my favorite even over the newest Oasis because I like the shape better. A warm light is an essential feature for me after using the Oasis and the lighting on my PW is slightly more even than on my Oasis, even though the PW has less LED's. The screen clarity and sharpness look identical to me, so it really comes down to the shape since they fit about the same amount of text. Unless you really can't live without the page turn buttons, then the PW is probably the better option for most people. I thought I was one of those people who needed the physical buttons, but I don't miss them at all.I will say there is something I love about the Kindle basic with front light size wise. I still take that one out with me when I travel because it's a really great size, light, and very pocketable. I think my ideal device would be a Kindle basic with 300ppi, warm light, and shrunken bezels to fit say a 6.3-6.5 inch screen while keeping the physical dimensions the same. That would probably be my unicorn device. They could call it the Kindle plus and sell it for 120ish and would be a day one purchase for me.I predict the next Oasis will be 8-10 inches and have note taking capability with a stylus. There's not much of a reason to spend the extra money on the Oasis now that this newest PW is out. It's that good.

    I am discovering that not all Kindle books are compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. I will probably be returning this and sticking to Apple books unless Amazon can resolve the problem for me. THIS IS AN ADDENDUM THE DAY AFTER I WROTE THIS REVIEW. For the first time ever, I got a call back from Amazon about my review and my unhappiness. Together, the Amazon rep and I looked at the book in question. If you scroll down a little on the book page, there is a drop-down menu that says ""available devices."" Clicking on that menu revealed that the book, indeed, is not available on my Kindle device, but is available on Kindle Fire, various Kindle apps, and cloud reader. I appreciated the callback and recommended that where books are not available on all Kindle devices, that is communicated in a more obvious way. I was impressed with Amazon's callback, but I can't go all the way to a 4 or 5-star review until I see that some changes have been made.

So I went back to Amazon and ordered the cable indicated for the Paperwhite 8GB and waited a week for it to arrive only to discover it is not compatible with the Kindle 8GB. It is not returnable, which is fine, but I have no one to contact at Amazon or the seller SMAYS to get the correct cable. Not a good way to do business. I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for quite a while and have to say this is the most disappointing transaction ever.

    I chose this over libra 2, here's why
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had a first generation paperwhite, and this kindle has been a great upgrade overall. Definitely a lot faster, warm light and dark mode are great features, and USB-C is a huge plus for me. I've only had it for a few days so I can't comment on the battery life yet, so far so good. The only flaw I can find is that it doesn't stay connected to my school wifi, which is a little annoying.I was choosing between the kindle pw5 and kobo libra 2 and bought both devices to test them out. I am going to keep the pw5. Libra 2 is a great device, if I must say the better device. It also has overdrive support. In my case, I use my ereader almost solely for library books so this is a huge plus for me. However, kindle has all the features that I care about and was much cheaper, even though my trade-in promotions didn't come in time for black friday promotion due to some system error. I'm also not the biggest fan of the asymmetrical design of the libra 2 and couldn't care less for physical buttons, and the pw5 feels good in my hands since it's thinner and I can hold it with one hand without feeling like the other side is too heavy. On the other hand, the libra 2 definitely has better contrast and a nicer display. You won't really miss it though with the pw5, which has a great display as well.Overall, kobo's libra 2 is the better device and I would definitely recommend it over the signature edition. Compared to the regular pw5 though, the lower price of pw5 makes them about equal, and personally the pros of the libra 2 wasn't worth the extra 90 dollars and the cons of pw5 had easy workarounds for me.

    Marked improvement from 2018 version.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgraded via trade-in of my 2018 Paperwhite when the 2021 went on sale ($109) so I received a $30 credit for trade-in value and the 20% discount Amazon provides on top of the sale. I was hesitant at first to upgrade considering I just purchased the 2018 version in September 2021 right before new one was released, but I couldn't wait any longer. The 2018 was noticeably slower to respond to touch and longer to download. I also found the text to be somewhat fuzzy. Not only is the 2021 faster to respond, the text seems clearer. Another thing I didn't like about the 2018 was the brightness seemed too bright with too much blue light compared to the original Kindle. I think it was maybe the placement of the screen lighting which is so much better in the newer version even without having to turn on dark mode or warm light. For these reasons I recommend the upgrade for people on the fence about switching from the 2018. For people who are new to the Kindle line-up, here are my complaints about the Paperwhite: Still no physical page-turn buttons and could be more ergonomic for one-hand use. Although the Oasis includes these features, the reported short battery life is a deal-breaker for me for the price-point. Hopefully in the next iteration of the paperwhite Amazon will add these features.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I made a pact with myself that I would never buy another Kindle until they came out with USB-C charging as the micro ports are so easy to damage and my last Paperwhite was rendered almost useless because of said port.  So I had to wait two years but it was well worth the wait as the new Paperwhite is everything I‚Äôd hoped for.Dark Mode, yes, finally!Sharp, easy on the eyes text at night, yes!Upgraded lighting and a ‚Äòwarmth‚Äô setting, yes!Expanded sorting - keeping series together, yes!Even though it is still 300ppi it seems higher because of the much improved lighting. I‚Äôm in Kindle heaven right now.*Update:  Okay, my initial excitement has diminished a bit. After using this new Paperwhite for four months I am so disappointed with a BIG FLAW in the design of this which is the power button. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in a slightly different place or if it‚Äôs just too sensitive, but I inadvertently turn it off way too frequently while reading and it‚Äôs become so annoying! This is my fourth Paperwhite and I have never had this problem with the previous models so they definitely changed something, and the question is WHY?  Another smaller problem that is not a big deal really but is also different than previous models is the delay in waking. My other Paperwhites upon awakening immediately show the swipe message, but half the time this new one first says it‚Äôs waking up, then shows the swipe message. It‚Äôs only a couple extra seconds but I just wonder why it‚Äôs doing that.

    I bought this kindle a few weeks ago after my 7th generation stopped working. I had it almost 6 years and I read daily so I was not upset to buy a new one except that I hate having to redownload everything to its memory. I wish it did that automatically. The new one is a little bigger. I thought I would like it but it actually just makes it a little hard to hold and change pages with one hand. I have also struggled  to find a self standing case that works well with this size. It annoys me that almost every time I open the cover of the case I get a ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù msg before I can slide the touch screen to activate it, but otherwise it works much like my prior paperweight. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to read, and I love the adjustable light functioning. It‚Äôs a good ereader for a person who reads hundreds of books a year.

    I am not as impressed as I was prepared to be.  The touch screen is mediocre at best.  Scrolling down, while reading the tutorial, it jumped over some areas and you have to tediously ease the screen to the proper position.  Page turning is another subject.  You can touch the screen heavily or lightly, and sometimes it will turn 1 page and sometimes 2-4 pages. It‚Äôs annoying trying to find your place again.  I do not use the paper white to search for books on Amazon, it‚Äôs too frustrating.  I search for books, read reviews, and back covers  using the kindle app on my cell phone.  It says it has a 10 week battery life but perhaps that is if you don‚Äôt use it to read.  I have had it for maybe two weeks and I‚Äôve charged it no less than 3 times but I think I have read 4-5 books during that time on it.  So maybe I have above average usage.  I have not tested the waterproof property yet.

I was able to send in my old kindle for 20% off a new kindle, which I completely recommend doing if you have no use for it. I‚Äôve had Nook Glowlights In the past but hated that there would always be bright specks on the screen. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with that. The screen does not have areas hat are brighter than others. The touchscreen works great and the battery life is amazing and my favorite is the warmth feature to change the warmth of the light. I usually purchase the audible narration as an add on to my kindle books, love the whisper sync option so I can pick up where I left off when alternating from audible to the kindle. Kindle Unlimited has also been great. I didn‚Äôt think there would be such good books available, but I was pleasantly mistaken. I do recommend getting a case that has a strap for your hand. Since the bezel is thin it‚Äôs a little awkward to hold. Nothing a case can‚Äôt fix. Happy reading!

    This kindle is perfect! I took it with me on a trip to Hawaii. The battery lasted the whole time, and I was reading a LOT. I was really impressed I didn't have to charge it, and it still lasted me like another couple of days. Very impressed with the battery life! The light & blue light filter are awesome bc you can customize how much you want of each.

    I had a Kindle Keyboard for forever that still worked great, but I was forced to purchase a new kindle because my old one will no longer be supported (won‚Äôt be able to download new books), This new kindle is fine, but the page turning function on my old kindle was so.much.better. It had buttons on both sides of the screen so you could flip pages forward or backward with either hand without moving your fingers, just a little squeeze. Now I can only flip forward on the right, back on the left, giving less options for how I hold the kindle. And it sometimes flips two pages, so you have to keep an eye out for skipping pages. Also, I don‚Äôt like that I have to touch the screen, because now I have to clean my greasy little fingerprints off of it all the time (from lotion, snacks, and just being a human). From a usability standpoint, I‚Äôm really disappointed. And it‚Äôs even worse that I was forced in to buying this when my old kindle worked great.

    I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long to buy a Kindle. I love reading but I slog through books at a slow pace. I have to use a book maker to direct my eyes & rein my mind to focus. I started using OpenDyslexic on my computer a few years ago but did not know that I could change the text on a Kindle to OpenDyslexic! I got my Kindle Paperwhite last night & now I‚Äôm halfway though The Sirens of Titan no more slogging through! This little change to the font, the e-ink screen & dark mode made so much of a difference for me. I‚Äôm not saying to will cure the sick but it made such a difference for me. I have a back log from years that I‚Äôm going to get on my kindle now.

    Bigger and mostly better than the old Paperwhite I had
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Only one dislike, the old one could fit in some of my overshirt pockets and most of my pants pockets.  This is bigger and so I must carry it separately.  I love the extra screen area, it makes reading easier and page turning a little less frequent.  I really like the waterproof feature (although I haven't tested it yet).  My last version drowned when it got put in a bag with some spilled soda.  Oh well.This is a delight to read, especially on the beach when you can't begin to read your phone even at 100% brightness.  The battery life does suffer some from the lighting, but it is well worth it for the ease of reading in dim surroundings.  This is our family's 7th kindle (I still have the one with a keyboard and it still works).  The resolution is great, I put a technical journal PDF on it and tried to read it.  The print was WAY too small to read, but I looked with a powerful magnifying glass and the tiny tiny print was beautifully formed.  I suspect that's part of what makes it easy to read normal print.

    I have used a Kindle for years and bought this new one about 6 months ago.  I like reading on it very much and appreciate the longer battery life.

    UPDATED - ‚ÄúOld Software‚Äù
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My new Kindle arrived on release day, and in all aspects except one, I love it. It is zippy, the text is crisp and clear, and the backlighting is wonderful. I‚Äôm coming from a 7th Gen Kindle (which has now become my husband‚Äôs) so the speed, extra LEDs, and the warm lighting are big improvements for me. I actually love the bigger size, I‚Äôve read 4 books in as many days on it, and I just adore it. That being said, this next part of the review is based purely on the fact that it came with the old software, well the old interface anyway, and the option to update it manually is greyed out. When I contacted customer service (who were RUDE!) they said it is running the current software 5.14 and there are no updates available at this time for the BRAND NEW device. So, is 5.14 supposed to have the old interface? My husband‚Äôs 7th Gen Kindle updated to 5.13.7 and has the new interface. So, it would appear that my Kindle is running ‚Äúnewer‚Äù software, but it sure does look like the old interface to me (see photo). I‚Äôm keeping it because I love it, and with the hopes that there will be an update to fix this obvious software error soon. It really is a GREAT new Kindle otherwise, I just hope they push out an update ASAP, as it appears I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing software issues. I will update my review accordingly. The new fabric cover is excellent! It has a great feel to it, and is lightweight. It is more pink than lavender, which is fine by me. I love the fabric texture a lot.*UPDATE: Customer service reached out to me to let me know that they froze the current software from updating once they discovered that it was causing issues. They are working to resolve the bug, and the software will be updated once it is. I knew it was something along these lines, and it would‚Äôve been helpful to have customer service say that in the first place. Bugs happen, just tell us!

    Horrible UI, great reading experience
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    It's just wonderful to read on an e-ink kindle. They did a great job on the backlight, too.But wow, navigating and using it is just horrible. It took me DAYS to figure out how to go back to the main menu from a book. They added a swipe from the top function that pretty much any phone user knows well. This lets you change settings on the fly, which is great, but the problem is, it establishes that swiping is how you get around. However, there's actually a small tap section at the top of the screen that you need to tap, not swipe, in order to bring up the UI to actually go home. So, way to screw that one up, Amazon. Taping anywhere else just turns the page.Navigating the library and store is also horribly slow and unwieldly. But that matters very little, because you can just use the website or your phone to manage your books, and all you really need from the Kindle is the ability to display and turn pages, and it does that VERY well.

    Warm light less than expected
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this device and thought I would particulary like the warm light.  I have a Samsung tablet  that I read books on with a nice parchment background and thought the warm light would be something similar, it is not.  I find the warm light makes it harder to read in normal circumstances.  It can be beneficial if trying to reduce light in a dark room where you would be keeping your partner awake, but night mode is better for that.  So I NEVER use Warm mode.I have the previous Paprewhite in addition to the 2021 version.  The main thing I like is the bigger screen and better resolution, so much so I would never think of picking up the older one, ever!So there is alot to love with the 2021 Paperwhite, just forget about the warm light.Battery life is fantastic, be sure to turn on Airplane mode for max life. Also finally a type C connector, thank goodness. I bought the Cobak case and that is a terrific buy.The only problem is the Paperwhite is so compelling I have been reading so much I cannot get anything else done around the house!

    A huge improvement for 2018 Paperwhite Owners
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm glad up I upgraded to the 2021 Paperwhite from my 2018 Paperwhite.  I was on the fence about purchasing this Kindle Paperwhite since 2018 version was perfectly fine and the upgrades seemed so incremental (slightly larger screen; faster processor; warm lighting & better lighting array).  All these little changes make for a big difference in reading experience. I'll address all the new features in comparison to the 2018 Paperwhite.Processor Speed.  The processor is fast.  There's no delay in turning pages anymore.  On the 2018 Paperwhite, there was a millisecond delay in touching the screen and turning the page.  There's barely any detectable delay for the 2021 Paperwhite.  White this might not sound like it makes a difference, it changes the reading experience a lot.  The device feels super responsive and makes the reading experience much more encompassing.Screen Size.  The 2021's 6.8"" screen is only .8"" bigger than the 2018, but that makes for a lot of additional text.  When you combine the bigger screen size with the new processor, it makes the reading experience much more immersive.LEDs.  The warm LEDs are a nice touch for nighttime reading.  It's an aesthetic preference but if you like warm colored lights, it's nice.Other miscellaneous things.  - USB C is nice...(microusb's finickiness about being plugged in precisely has always been annoying).  - I don't notice a difference in increased weight because of how it is distributed, but some people might.The 2018 Paperwhite was a great device and I read a lot of very long books on it.  The 2021 Paperwhite iterates and improves on all the annoyances of the 2018 Paperwhite.  Once you experience this version, it would be difficult to go back to reading on an older model.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought a refurbished 2019 kindle last year and I wanted to upgrade because of the battery. I bought the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite a few weeks after it was released and it took some time to get used to (going from a 6 inch display to a 6.8 inch display). I'm not sure if it was just my unit but it's been pretty buggy up to date. I always get this error message out of nowhere and for some reason it's slower than my 2019 Kindle. My unit specifically seemed kind of loose as well but it didn't interfere with anything so I've just learned to ignore it. In terms of battery life, this thing is great! I keep my brightness around 6-9 at night with the warmth midrange and I read for hours on end but it's lasted me forever and a half each time. Being able to control the warmth is something that also made me switch models because the white light was getting to be a bit much before bed on my 2019 model. As for the screen size, I assumed I'd like it because I'd have more content on the screen at once which works well on top of reading with a smaller font (which I always prefer). However, having gone around with it in my bag or even just trying to walk around my home with the Paperwhite in hand is kind of a hassle. I have smaller hands to begin with and even with a pop socket I'm constantly having to reach. It's all together just an uncomfortable reading experience for me compared to the 6 inch display. On another note, the USB-C is a life saver being that I only have to carry one cable for a number of devices. All that being said though, I actually made the switch back to my 2019 Kindle. While the battery, warm light, and USB-C are great, I can't get over the glitching. Also, the 6.8 inch display is too unconventional for my smaller bags and just holding the device in general. I think the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite is a monumental upgrade from previous years, it just wasn't for me.

    I like the new Kindle. But have some things I would like to change.1. There is no wifi on or off. Just airplane mode in and off which works opposite to the idea of wifi on( airplane off) and wifi off (airplane on) and this drives me nuts!!!Amazon, Just just ""wifi on or off""! Im just amazed you wound even make this crazy change!üò§2. Can you change the highlights function?I highlights stuff for notes to be saved later and often this includes a bit of a long paragraph. But the problem is just a slight touch of the highlighted part and the whole thing is immediately changed to edit mode. Can't you guys make it so that a long press is needed instead? I keep bumping my fingers on a highlight and the edit function that pops up bothers me a lot.3. I'm not a fan of the bottom switch. That's the last place I would want to hold when picking up a Kindle or turning it on.

    Buyer beware...three paperwhites in six months that go to frozen white screen
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update June 13, 2022  Amazon has agreed to issue a refund for this Paper White.  I return the product to Amazon tomorrow.  Customer Service, for this organization, continues to consider the customer when it comes to issues such as this; which is very encouraging when doing business with such a big retailer. Update: June 12, 2022  Note:  I seldom write such a negative review but feel other people purchasing this paperwhite should know what they are buying.  3rd replacement 8G paperwhite/box says refurbished even though I originally purchased a new one.I received a third replacement 8G paperwhite (apparently refurbished) from Amazon because the other two units went to a frozen white screen after having it for a short period of time.  I've have had this unit for approximately three/four weeks and was working fine until last night when it started to reboot it's self for no reason and failed to bring up a book or wouldn't go from page to page....once again reverting to the 3rd unit's slow down. The entire device was in slow motion. These are the same things that have happened with the previous two devices eventually leading to nothing but a frozen white screen.Today this unit has been a frozen white screen all day.  I am not able to try and reboot it due to the white screen and turning it off and on does nothing to fix this unit.  I will be calling Amazon and asking for a full refund.  Amazon has been good in replacing this paperwhite (3) times but I am done getting  replacements that keep doing the same thing the previous ones did. There must be something internally wrong in this paperwhite's structure and will research that further on some other web sites since Amazon would not allow me to turn this model in for a different model type the last go around.  I don't want a replacement of the same product at this time.  I am done with this paper white and greatly disappointed that this unit is such a ""lemon"".My other devices which include a five year old Kindle and a newer I Phone are not experiencing any of these issues with either the kindle app or kindle unlimited.  I even changed the charging plug to the new unit with no change to the frozen white screen.  How does a five year old refurbished Kindle still work while this one doesn't?.  Checked my WiFi strength and all is well...no other issues with all the other devices using a WiFi connection.  My I phone and my older kindle are not experiencing the frozen screen or connectivity issues that this Kindle is experiencing.  They both come up without any issues with my Kindle library and Kindle unlimited.I'm not sure how Amazon is going to react with my request, but will update this review once I speak with someone from their helpdesk. They have been very helpful in the past but I wasn't asking for a refund...I accepted a replacement.  I had hoped that the third paperwhite would work as expected and am greatly  disappointed that it did not.  Be thorough in your research before purchasing this paperwhite, or better yet....get a different model.I use Amazon quite a bit and have never had issues with a product such as this reader.  Returns have always been seamless and customer service has always been helpful.  It's very disappointing to be having these issues with a company that I have grown to respect over the years for their efficiency in dealing with  these kinds of issues. I take care of all my electronics and purchased a leather/type protective book cover  for the very first unit. I've used that cover with each of these readers.  The unit itself looks as new as it did the day I received it, but doesn't work anymore.Good luck...I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.

Help files on the device only help after you install the device!No screen freezes so far, everything works fine.The interface is ok, no complaints though it isn't a big improvement from the old one.

    This my first Kindle reader and probably my last.  I have an older model Kindle Fire that I prefer reading.  The reader's battery lasts much longer, and it is lighter and fits easier into a purse.  However, the reader is more complicated when it comes to marking a page, returning to the book if you look at something else, turning pages.  I like the Fire's ability to show book covers in color.  The Fire will be my next purchase when I tire of this one.

    I have used amazon many times each month and this is the first time the explanation of the item is not well explained  Actually it is very misleading.  I am disappointed in the way it was portrayed and there is no way to tell me that a downloaded book cost as much as a printed one.  What happened to Save the planet!!!

    It's slower than my old kindle keyboard...
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Got a new Kindle because my wife had slowly taken over my old keyboard version. I wasn't worried because I thought newer would be better, but it's anything but. The lack of buttons was a terrible idea as was the flush screen that covers the bezels. The fingerprints that this thing accumulates are horrendous. You can't really hold it without leaving fingerprints around the part of the screen that covers the bezels and the touch controls are finicky. I'll touch the right side of the screen which should trigger a page advance but it often goes in reverse instead. This often causes multiple taps to get what you want, leaving more finger prints. You basically have to bring a cloth with you everywhere you go to wipe them off.The lack of buttons for page turns is a much bigger deal than I anticipated. I really miss the precision of the buttons and the ease of being able to hold the Kindle with one hand, thumb over the advance button. All it took was a bit of pressure to turn the page. I initially looked for a Kindle Keyboard when considering a new purchase, but discovered they had stopped making them. I really wish I had purchased a used one or had seen the Kobo Libra 2, as it also has physical buttons and bezels you can actually touch without leaving fingerprints.My old Kindle is also faster. It starts up and navigates the menus faster than the new one. The new device also occasionally lags. You'll go to turn the page and nothing will happen. You'll two it again thinking the first two just didn't register. Maybe you two it a third or fourth time. Then all of a sudden, it lurches back into action and registers all of the taps launching you forward several more pages than you intended. That may make sense in an app liker Lightroom where you may be trying to adjust multiple files at once and have to wait for the device to catch up, but this is a book. You read a page, turn the page, and then take time to read the next page. You never get going fast enough to explain why the device lags so bad. I really feel like the new ones are a big step back in design.

    This is my first E-reader . These things take some getting used to. I‚Äôm still learning my way around it. I miss being able to go right to a part of a book by flipping through pages based on my mental image of where the words were on the page. However, it‚Äôs awesome that I can make the print larger and adjust the brightness so I can read pretty much anywhere regardless of the surrounding light. And I can carry multiple books around with me in a very small space. I had a technical problem, but I actually got good technical assistance by phone. The tech person had great communication.

    Missing Immersion Reading
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the previous generation Paperwhite and loved the immersion reading feature (the audiobook plays through headphones while the text being said is highlighted.) After it was stolen I bought the newest generation and was disappointed to find that the immersion reading feature doesn't exist on it! It's very strange that this device has now been released for a while and still doesn't have this feature.Another pretty minor negative is that the device is a bit heavier than the last generation, so more uncomfortable for holding for long periods of time.The screen warmth feature is nice for winding down at night. I guess I will have to live with listening to the audiobook on my phone and manually turning through the book. Hopefully they bring this feature back soon.

    Oasis to Paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    In 2019 I traded in my kindle for an Oasis. Unfortunately, I forgot to check the seat pocket on a flight and left it behind. And yes, you can call Amazon to have it reported lost and they shut it down. I was wondering if I could spend less to replace it and be satisfied? I like the paperwhite better. I have small hands and arthritis in my thumbs. This is actually easier for me to handle and has the wonderful lighting of the Oasis that doesn‚Äôt contribute to my insomnia. I‚Äôm so glad to be back reading on my kindle instead of my IPAD. I‚Äôm flying again tomorrow and I‚Äôll never forget to check those seat pockets agin!

    The Kindle I've been waiting for!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    For years now, I've had all USB-C devices - except for my Kindle. Luckily, the Kindle battery lasts a long time. Unluckily, this means I usually can't remember where I put my micro-USB charger when I need to charge it again. When I saw that a new Kindle was available that used USB-C chargers instead of the old micro-USB, I immediately bought it. Now I can use one charger for all my devices and that right there would have made me happy. But this device gets five stars because it's made me love Kindle all over again.I prefer dark mode on my computer and phone. I now have one on my Kindle!The bezels on this thing aren't quite razor thin yet - but it's about the size of my old Kindle with much more screen real estate.The battery lasts longer.For the first time ever, I paid to have the ads turned off. Even without doing that, I can tell you the page turns are faster than before too.Using this Kindle vs my last one is night and day.

    A Good Solid Kindle Device.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought it to replace my 6-inch Voyage and because I was interested in a bigger screen.  I love the screen, but I miss the physical buttons on my Voyage.  The screen tap method works OK, but a tap the right side of the screen turns the page forward, and a tap on the left turns the page backward.  I'd prefer to have the top part of the screen turn back pages, and the bottom part turn pages forward.  I have years of muscle memory to overcome, plus, it would make one handed page turns more comfortable.  Maybe this could be fixed in a software update?  It'd be great if that were done.I also like the smooth screen that integrates solidly with the bezel.  No dust to collect in the corners.  The Type ""C"" connector is much appreciated.  The sooner we get to a single 'universal' connection standard, the better, in my mind.I don't really use the other stuff.  Warm screen options, more lights, seem irrelevant to me.  They work, but after checking to see that they do work, I don't really know how well they work on a day-to-day basis.I'm kind of surprised at how limited the 3rd party case options are for this device.  I'd have thought Amazon would have been more aggressive in recruiting 3rd party developers.I don't regret buying this device, it's a good solid Kindle device with no glaring negative features.

    I upgraded from a Paperwhite Gen 7 when I found out this has a few features I wanted. USB c charger and warm mode. Overall I am happy with my purchase. It isn‚Äôt quite as ergonomic to hold as my previous one and I find myself accidentally turning pages often, which is a milder complaint. There is a method to temporarily turn off all touch screen functions except to swipe pages, however I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me, but it takes several swipe just to turn page.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The battery life is better, the screen a bit bigger, and I like that it is water resisted.

    Honestly, I like almost everything about my kindle. It‚Äôs a nice weight, comes with an adjustable light, has great features, and the battery life lasts for a long time. The type of light is nice too since it‚Äôs t doesn‚Äôt keep me awake when I read at night. My only potential criticism is that I find it slightly more difficult to navigate than my previous version. Also, while I can adjust the font size, I can only choose small medium or large. I can‚Äôt customize it like I could before. Still, I love ‚ù§Ô∏è it. Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without it anymore. I hardly ever read a ‚Äúreal‚Äù book these days. The kindle is just so much more convenient.

    I am a owner of the kindle keyboard with page turner on each side. I also have a generation 6.  I figured with updated technology the 2021 would be easier to read the hone screen and my library.  I have MS and it gets hard to read the list.That theory and reasoning went out the window.  1st - the fo nt is smaller and lighter 9n the home/library screen. Than either of my e readers.  The book layout is fuzzy and dark no matter how bright.  But fuzzy...blurry..however you want to put it, is usualess so i put it on list.  It's in light printer, the 6th is bold print.I can change my book font fine.  But its usualess if I can't find the title or read to put in Groups.  I have a lot of books so my eye strain would literally be impossible.I was sitting there last night setting it up with a magnifying glass.  My vision changes as my MS does. So at least the 6th print is bold.I called chatted with the help line to see if there was a way to e hence or enlarge the hone screen/library and while I turned it on to follow steps he gave me (before finding out it can't be done) as I turned it on.  I swiped it, then it started a reboot the white out on me.  I turned it off, gave it a few seconds ds,  still nothing but white page.  The svc te h told me to shut it down, wait 10 mi utes and restart the eReader.  I did and it came back up after looking like going through another reboot. As I stated after he had me do things his supervisor said it couldn't be done.I almost bought the 7 inch kindel fire 32 gb for 32.98 . I have a 8 inch so 8i debated to get the 7inch instead of a new eReader.So it's going back due to whiting out and I can't read it.  I wish I had gone with my gut and gotten the 7 inch fire fore 32.98I can't get that deal again,  since prine is over.  but my Gen 6 is working fine so I guess I will wait till Christmas to see if the 7 inch goes on sale.Very disappointed. Even the 1st little keyboard the page turners were on there, for 89.00 full price.  now you have to pay prime $$ to get the function that was a norm.This isn't for me.I

    I've had my ""new"" Kindle for about 2 weeks and I can safely say this is the best I've had.  I love the quick action going into sleep mode; is easy to handle; it charges way faster than my older Kindle; and the charge lasts longer, too.It has a ""WAKE UP"" mode for when it's off for quite a while; click the button and it goes from ""wake up"" to ""swipe to unlock"" and you're all set.  I have noticed a huge increase in how long the power charge lasts which I love.  The brightness is better than the old Kindle, also.The best part is the instructions showed me how to get rid of 22 pages of ""group by author/series"" catalogs that came at the end of my books.  Gosh, I HATED those, especially when the books I haven't read yet got mixed up in the bunch!!Overall, thanks Amazon for the new Kindle and all it good features!

    I very much love this new kindle. They finally got around to a lot of improvements that should've honestly been done a while ago, such as the USB-C port and improved battery life. I also love that it's so light and easy to hold. I may be in the minority, but I appreciate that it's still got a bit of a bezel to hold onto. My only real complaint is with the most recent software update that has restructured the home page. The ability to scroll and that the titles are a little smaller is appreciated. However, I really hate that there's no longer a toggle between downloads/full library. You can still do it via the filters, but it's such an unnecessary extra step when I get a new book I'm trying to download. All of the other improvements are wonderful.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgraded to this device from the 6‚Äù Kindle. Nothing wrong with the old one, I just thought this one offered more bells and whistles than the last iteration. Spoiler Alert - it does not.Recently, I finally bit the bullet and began taking advantage of my Audible membership. I like using my Galaxy Note20 Ultra phone to read on because it‚Äôs easier to manage, size-wise. The Kindle app for Android is fantastic! It loads in seconds, and it‚Äôs very versatile and responsive. And when I use Audible, I can read along with the narrator.When I got my new Paperwhite Kindle, I was excited to do the same thing. However, on the Paperwhite, not only can you NOT read along with the narrator (you‚Äôre given the choice of text with no audio, or audio with no text). I‚Äôm baffled as to why an app performs better, and has better options than the device itself.Also, there is no speaker on the Paperwhite, so, you‚Äôre forced to use a Bluetooth device to enjoy your audiobooks. On my phone, I don‚Äôt need to use.an ancillary listening device. With the Paperwhite, you have to touch the very top of of the screen to access an unimpressive menu; on the app, you can touch anywhere on the page, where you can bring up a menu with several more options. With the app, I can also color-code my highlights. I use one color for words I‚Äôve just learned, and another color for key phrases, another color for foreign words, and, yet another for names I want to look up later. You get none of that on the Kindle device.Honestly, the Kindle app has this thing beat in every category. It makes me wonder why I even bought the thing, when the free app is decidedly better in every way, other than screen size.All in all, I actually like the Paperwhite Kindle. However, after forking over $150 (including tax), I still find myself reading on my phone quite a bit. There are times when I‚Äôm going out, and carrying two devices can be cumbersome, I obviously opt for my phone over the Kindle as the device I‚Äôll take with me.Dear Amazon, on your next Kindle iteration, please:1) add a speaker to your Kindle2) Give users the option to read along with the narration. I‚Äôve found it makes the narrators performance even more impressive.

    Pain With Transfers
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    We bought two newer versions of Kindle Paperwhite for a number of reasons. The devices appear to be solidly built and for newbies, these are great readers. For those of us who have been using an older model and wanted to upgrade, the path is full of rocks. There appears to be no easy way to transfer OLD content, bookmarks, etc to the NEW paperwhite. A simple software solution would be to offer a ""transfer"" function especially for those who do a trade-in. How would it work? Click ""transfer content"" then choose the FROM Kindle paperwhite name and then TO Kindle name. Downloading every book, document et al one by one...or everything and then exclude items one by one is painful. If I find (or am informed) of a simple way to do this, I will update this review but at the moment, I am in the midst of trying to upgrade two Kindles...

    I have so many ebooks but never could finish any of them because I would get distracted with all the apps on my phone. The kindle paper white is the perfect solution. I set mine for dark mode which is really easy on the eyes. It‚Äôs simple enough to use. I thought the ads would be annoying but they aren‚Äôt. The size is nice and the battery last a long while. The only down side is the library view only shows 6 books at a time, this can take forever to scroll through if you have lots of books. Also the browsing function for books is not user friendly. I tried to find some books for my daughter on the kindle paperwhite and I could filter through them adequately. Finding new books is just easier on the app or website. Very happy I have it and would recommend to others.

    This is not a technical review because I don‚Äôt pay attention to or know anything about specifics of brightness or whatnot.

Read with one hand. At time of purchase, mine came with 4 months of free kindle unlimited. Unfortunately, I love it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll continue to pay for it but for the time being, let me tell you, I am taking advantage. Use your library for books too. I love that it is so easy to look up books in the kindle store and I LOVE that I can pair it with my Goodreads account. This helps me track my books efficiently and remember to at least give a star rating for my thoughts when I finish a book.I love reading this in bed at night. I can turn the brightness levels down, there is a dark mode setting, I can make the font bigger when I take off my glasses‚Ä¶Buy this and love your reading life. Highly recommend.

    Confusing Replacement for Original Kindle
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My first discovery with this new Kindle was that it no longer offers direct book ordering from Amazon via my desktop.  You must have Wi-Fi to access your library or order a book.  The new layout is confusing: you no longer have a list of books in your library, but rather pictures of book covers, arranged in no apparent order.  I was able to find the book I had been reading on my old Kindle (it died after five years of heavy use), but the discovery was by chance.The former manual keys for advancing or retreating pages are gone.  There are no keys at all.  Everything is touch screen.  For someone like myself with Carpal-Tunnel Syndrome, this can be difficult.  I'm getting used to it.The visual text quality is superior to the old Kindle, although detailed graphics such as maps or drawings are no better than before.  Overall, I wish I could get my old Kindle back.

    A big welcomed upgrade
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the 2018 paperwhite for over a year and it was a great device but I always wished it had a bigger screen and warm lighting. I always knew warm lighting was better for the eyes but once you actually experience it it becomes essential. My eyes feel so much better reading for long periods. I always keep it on no matter what. I might turn it down when I have my overall brightness higher but it is always on. And the extra screen means less page turns and feels more equal to the size or a paperback book. The page turn animation is a very nice touch and makes the experience better adding some life to reading on a kindle. I'd highly recommend buying a case as the smaller bezels make it look sleek it also makes it harder to hold and the case adds some extra thickness making it easier to hold one handed. The quicker page turns and it feeling faster overall is a huge plus. I don't need lightning speed from a kindle but having the updated internet for it to support higher bandwidth makes it so much faster going through the store. I honestly don't see a huge difference in overall lighting with all the extra LED lights but that was never a selling point for me as I thought the previous ones brightness was fine. Overall I'd highly recommend buying this kindle even if you have the previous paperwhite. I can't imagine not having warmlight and the bigger display now. This will be my kindle for a very long time as I can't imagine needing more features than this for reading text.

    I mostly love everything about the new 11th generation kindle paperwhite!First, really quick, let me say what I don't like: it is heavier than previous generation, and the max brightness level sometimes doesn't seem bright enough in certain bright lighting. But these are minor and I still give 5 stars!I love the larger screen, closer margins, warm light is amazing for night reading, the charging port is updated to the usb-c so I can now use one charger for all my devices, the page looks even more textured for a more book like paper appearance, and battery life still great in my opinion! I usually only have to charge it once a week, but being a mom I don't get to read very heavily (moderatley and mostly at night). The warm light can be put on an automatic schedule or it can be set and adjusted easily from drop down quick menu. It was easy to connect to my Amazon account (it was a gift and not automatically connected). Very happy so far with it! I can never go back to reading on a phone/tablet again, this is much easier on the eyes by far!

    I don't like the lag that appears when I scroll. It just seems for the price tag that would have been something that would have been figured out already. I defnitely enjoy it to read books and someone who use to only read physical books, this is great since I can take it anywhere with me and I no longer have to hide scandalous book covers for some romance novels ;). I would highly recommend this to someone who is thinking of buying but hast commited yet. The battterly lasts weeks to and kindle unlimited has a lot of great options to read from.

    I loved my first Paperwhite purchased in 2013. I even bought them as gifts for several family members. I upgraded to a later model about 3 years ago and the battery life was practically nonexistent. So I tried again a couple of months ago and all was well‚Äîthe battery lasted longer and it worked as usual. Then it became necessary to restart almost every time I downloaded a new book. When I asked support about it their solution was to simply restart every time. Not happy. If I could figure out how to do it I‚Äôd go back to my first one.

I like that I can change the font color and size as well as type of font. I prefer black page and white letters for night because less light to disturb my husband. I am so glad I made the purchase.

    I originally left a 1 star review due to Amazon's poor service in the beginning for not helping me when my Kindle was damaged. I didn't have it for 30 days and the originally man I spoke with pretty much blew me off. Thankfully a day after I posted my review I was contacted by Amazon and the service I received was ten times better. The second man was very kind and was not rude to us. They refunded us for a new Kindle and we will be sending them back the old damaged one (obviously). I am very thankful for the help. The Kindle is an amazing product that I highly recommend. I wish I caught the name of the second man he was very kind (I think it was James??)

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I wasn't sure if I preferred this Kindle over my much older model at first, but I soon grew to love the bigger reading surface size size. I had some issues with the touch screen being a bit buggy, not advancing when I wanted it to, sometimes moving backwards when I wanted it to advance. I figured I just needed to get used to it, and I think I did get better at using it.  After a few months of use I noticed one small scratch on the screen, which I had never had happen to a kindle before. It wasn't super noticeable unless I was reading in sunlight. A few weeks later,  it simply froze up, and would not restart. They sent a replacement in the same model. After a month of use, the replacement has several scratches on the screen, one very noticeable, several somewhat noticeable if I'm reading in the sun. I've had both kindles in Amazon brand cases, I don't place it face down on surfaces, I always close the cover when I put it in a bag, etc. but I do read a lot in a lot of places. I've never had this happen before with any other kindle. Definitely consider a screen protector with this one.

Or at least make it flush with the bottom!!It‚Äôs bigger than the recent versions and I don‚Äôt need the added weight and size.When the kindle wakes, it always defaults to bright blueish light until it realizes it was supposed to be warm light.

    OK - Amazon starts out by asking, What did I use this product for...Guys, it's a reader. I didn't buy it to lay bricks.Not my first Kindle, alas my old one (a Gen 3 Keyboard) finally died an ugly death; had to replace it, and can't even begin to say how much I miss it.  The warm backlighting on this model is nice, I will admit, but that's the only thing I find to like.  The software keeps cutting out at odd moments -- pages don't turn, it is needlessly, obnoxiously difficult to move from chapter to chapter, and the library concept should have died in the womb.  It used to be a list, like for people who can read -- now it's a crappy, cumbersome clot of PICTURES -- I assume to assist the population subset of reader buyers who cannot actually read -- that takes forever (and a lot of excessive moves) to navigate through, and demands a whole lot of other unnecessary complications to do anything with.  Amazon is following the same trajectory as other device producers, given time: degrade the basic product despite a couple nicer features, and ignore what worked for the customer in favor of what Amazon wants.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    With over 6000 reviews i know my 2 cents worth may not mean a lot, but I'm giving a review anyway. The reason I purchased the Paperwhite was my older Fire HD gen 8's battery was starting to discharge fairly fast. I read a lot and figured from the favorable reviews, the Paperwhite with it supposed long battery life sounded good. I thought I didn't need a Fire just to read. Wrong! First impression, the Paperwhite is nice and light, compared to the weight of my Fire.  From there it was down hill. After giving it a week or so I was still unable to get a comfortable reading brightness and print darkness. Can't darken the print, only make the font bigger, which sucks. It's just gray and gives me eyestrain and the yellow warm light is a joke. My Fire has more font, spacing, and margin adjustments. Looking at books in my library is almost useless, the covers are just grey with little detail. Really, really miss that color here. Can't turn off Wi-Fi. You can only turn airplane mode on. That sucks battery down. And yes I turned battery saver on. That just makes you wait a bit for the reader to wake up. Battery life still not what's advertised. And don't get me started on the ""leather"" cover. It's a chunk of plastic with the thinnest, hardest leather known to man. It does protect the reader quite well but sounds like a plastic dinner plate when you set it on a table. All in all the Paperwhite is not worth its price and eye stain, I'm going back to my Fire HD. It is so much easier to read on and I don't have to go to my phone to read emails.  Maybe I'll figure out how to replace its battery. AND, I love having that color.

    My grandson gave me a paper white for Christmas. It was working great and I downloaded about 10 books in my library.  Then it quit working today. When I try to bring up the page to read, it is blank white. No words appear. So, from the end of December until the end of April, that is only 4 months.  What's the deal with this?UPDATE: I was surprised when a representative called me and was willing to walk  me through the restart proceedure. It is working fine right now. I'll wait and see if I have any more problems with it.  I originally gave this a one star review, but changed it to a 3 when I was contacted. I shouldn't have any problems with it at all.  My old Kindle with the key board and buttons still works fine, and I never had any problems with it. But after December I was told I couldn't download new books to it. So, my grandson bought me a Paperwhite Kindle.  After reading some of the bad reviews, you'd think they would fix the glitches with their paperwhite Kindle.  After doing a re-boot, it seems to be working fine now. I'll reserve further comment to see if this happens again. My old one, they just updated every so often and I never had any problems with it. What has happened to the quality?  My old one lasted over 10 years! It isn't broken, they just quit supporting it and would no longer let you download new books to it.  Why are there so many glitches in the Paperwhite version?

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have buying Kindles since the Kindle 2 back in 2009.  I‚Äôve purchased the K2, K3, Voyage (the best offering IMHO), Oasis (worst offering in my POV), the original Paperwhite, and the 2018 Paperwhite.  This Kindle is a modest improvement over the 2018 Paperwhite.  It starts MUCH faster.  The lighting is great.  And, it‚Äôs a little bigger.  The placement of the power button at the bottom has never been an issue for me, so I don‚Äôt mind it.  Hardware is fine.My only complaints are related to the software.  Amazon has gotten MUCH more aggressive in pushing content.  Each software ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù makes it worse.  (Same reason I couldn‚Äôt stand the Fire tablet & recently ditched the 4K Fire Stick.) I have never really minded ads on the Kindle before because they didn‚Äôt interfere with getting to my content and sometimes I found a book I wanted to read.  But recent software updates annoyingly push Amazon content to the forefront, something I resent in a device that I‚Äôve purchased.  I strongly believe the ‚Äúhome‚Äù screen should be configured by the customer, rather than  consisting of advertisements!  I paid to have ads removed, but that only impacts the screensaver, so certainly not worth $20.  Let me get rid of ALL ads, and I‚Äôd pay three times that!Another complaint is that Amazon randomly pushes updates, and it‚Äôs annoying that they can‚Äôt be delayed or scheduled!  One more issue ‚Äî for heaven‚Äôs sake please turn off auto highlights!  They are SO annoying, and the feature is buried, so not intuitive to turn off.  I bet that the percentage of customers who want this feature is tiny, but Amazon continues to default to it.I still love the Kindle and think it‚Äôs the best device for reading.  But, I my reservations grow, and I fear that aggressiveness in pushing content will soon ruin it.  If this continues, I will be looking at other options and don‚Äôt mind paying more if I can be rid of ads and simply enjoy reading.  If you‚Äôre going to charge for a device, then let customers have control of it.  If the device is merely a way to push content (as the Kindle is fast becoming), then give it away to prolific readers.

    I have an old Paperwhite that I got used in 2017. It finally got a crack in the screen, so I had to replace it. My old one used the same charger as my phone, which was very convenient. This new one needs a specific charger which is a pain to remember to pack if traveling. The screen is larger, which is nice. But the smaller margins make it difficult to hold without constantly accidentally changing pages. I read curled up on my side 99% of the time, and I always lose my page (sometimes it skips several pages, and it's difficult to find where you left off), or drop the Kindle trying not to touch the screen. It also frequently locks up and won't respond. The worst part is that your books aren't actually there. We recently had a power outage for several days. I finished the book I was reading and went to my library to start a new one.  It couldn't open any of my books because it had no internet connection. Rendered it completely useless. I camp frequently (no internet in the woods) so I'm extremely disappointed. I went back to my cracked screen Kindle during the outage, but the battery was almost dead and didn't last long. The battery life on this one is ok, and the light filter is a nice touch. But between being difficult to hold if you're a side reader and not functioning without internet connection renders it nearly useless for me. I much prefer my older Paperwhite.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgrade from a kindle that was 10 years old. The main reason for why I got a new one is that I wanted one that was water resistant and didn't want to worry about damaging it while sailing. I am really enjoying this new kindle. I like the touch screen (major upgrade from my old one), the screen is a good size. It's not too big and fits enough words on it that I am not constantly flipping to the next page. I like how you can turn up the brightness if you want to. I have been mostly keeping the brightness all the way down because you don't need it if you're in good light. When you do turn the brightness up all the way it's too bright. The battery life seems to be good too. I have used it every day for 1-3 hours since I got it (6 days now) and the battery is at 77%. I did get worried the first day that I got it because I thought that the battery had already fallen to 85%, but then I realized that I was looking at the percentage of the the book that I already read. The layout of the Kindle is very different than my old one (not too surprising since my old one is 10 years old) and it did take me a few minutes to learn the new layout. Overall I am very happy.

    After eight years my iPad had seen better days. For the past few years, I had only been using it to read e-books, and spending the money for a new one didn't make sense. I decided to try out a Kindle because I had been using the app on my iPhone and iPad and didn't have any problems. I was concerned after reading a few reviews that I wouldn't be able to borrow books through Libby on this device. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away-it's very easy to get books from Libby onto this device!It does come with the charging cable, but not the adapter to plug it into the wall. However, chances are you already have a USB wall adapter. You can also charge it via your laptop or desktop if for some reason you don't have a USB adapter.I did find that was a little awkward to hold, but a Popscocket fixed that problem!

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    When I closed the cover on my previous paperwhite, it turned off the light but did not lock the screen.  When I opened it, I could go right back to reading where I left off.  With the new one, you have to swipe away the lockscreen before you can get back to reading.  It does not matter whether or not you have the ad-support feature.  I understand that there are times when you want your kindle to lock when you close it, but it is very annoying to have it always lock.  Disabling ""power saver"" mode has no impact.  Customer support verified that disabling the lock screen was possible on previous paperwhites but not on this version.So annoying!

    First off: I got an email saying my purchase qualified for 3 months free Unlimited. When I clicked on the link to add it to my Kindle, it said the purchase was NOT qualified. Customer Support said I could sign up for one month free, then pay for two additional months, then contact them at the end of that three month period for a refund. Uh... no.Secondly: the software is so slow... I used a friend's 2008 Kindle and it was faster to scroll, turn the page, and respond to the touch screen. I have to tap several times to get this to do anything. If it doesn't improve in a week, I'm returning it!

    I used to be able to sort into collections and view my books within the collection in a concise list view. I have no need to see the book jacket (which is actually missing in some of the books anyway) The only way to see my books in a list view is to have my library filled with all my books and collections in a mixed up manner.  What is the point of a collection if I cannot find it among my books (I keep hundreds of books on my kindle.)  I used to enjoy my kindle, recommend to everyone, but now I find it very frustrating.  Amazon, please fix this latest update to correct this issue. This is what it used to be: library should have only collections in a list, collections should show a list of books.

    Design:- Very thin and lightweight- Plastic is soft and doesn't feel cheap to hold.- Water resistant- Display is good quality, good resistance to fingerprints and glare, and can get very bright or low during reading.Features:- The battery life will last your whole life it seems- USB-C is a nice touch- software is pretty good for a e reader- tons of storage for books- Kindle Unlimited is a must have- The ads on the homescreen are not that badI currently own a Iphone 12 pro max. On paper the screen size doesn't look like a big upgrade, put in person the screen on the kindle is much more wider and the bezels make it easier to hold; not to mention that a E-ink display is a lot better for your eyes and puts less strain. Also less distraction than a phone or tablet.

    It is more than disappointing that no written instruction manual accompanies this product. I purchased my first Kindle at least 11 years ago and have used the tiny pamphlet of instructions since. Even the manuals advertised have terrible reviews. It is ridiculous to have access only to online instructions or those within the Kindle itself. Some people can still read a written page, Maybe this issue should be remedied.

    Old software on new device UPDATE.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My new paperwhite came with old software and, like another reviewer pointed out, the option to update to the new software was greyed out. I used the chat option to talk to customer service, and they are sending me a new one because they apparently did not have a way to update the device. Overall I like the new paperwhite, and my experience with customer service was positive. I‚Äôm disappointed that I have to wait a week for a replacement, but sometimes these things happen and it‚Äôs not the end of the world.Update: I received the replacement and had the same issue. After 1.5 hours chatting with five customer service representatives, the fifth representative was finally able to figure out that there was a problem with the updates and the technical team is working on it. So I‚Äôm happy to know this is just a bug, and that they are working on resolving the issues. For those of you who are experiencing the same thing, I wanted you to know Amazon is aware and working on the issue. I really like the new device and the amber lighting option is a game changer for those of us who read in bed in the dark.Update 2: The software updated on my new device on November 10th, so now I can give this five stars. I like the larger screen and the amber lighting for nighttime reading.

    I'll be frank.....I didn't want a Kindle. I felt that they were obsolete. Then, one day my eyes hurts from staring at my phone's screen and I remarked to myself, ""I wish there was a way to read books without hurting my eyes or draining the battery on my phone. Not to mention, freeing up much needed memory........Wait......"" Enter the Kindle. Overall, I'm satisfied with my device. I find it a better buy than a tablet. It focuses on reading - books, manga, and graphic novels in my case - and it has none of the distractions. I feel it will help me better myself and fulfill at least one of my New Year Resolutions. My only complaint is that the battery life. Yes, it lasts but I don't think I'll get anywhere near what Amazon says.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My 5th generation Kindle worked just fine and sometimes I would get an application error but I just restarted the device and it went away. The 11th generation has a larger 6.8"" display and looks a lot better than the older Kindle. I put both side by side and I really didn't notice a difference with the page turning speed but the main difference for the upgrade was the extra display size. I had a great soft leather case for the older Kindle and couldn't find one for the newer one so I finally went with the CoBak black smart cover case. I purchased it on a deal so I feel its worth the upgrade because I like to read primarily before retiring for the evening.

    Subtle but nice improvements in this model
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the last version and this is a nice upgrade.  Like the slightly larger size, very easy to read and like the new lighting options as well as the longer battery life.  But there are a couple default settings I think should be changed.  One is you see the popular highlights shown in a book, and in my opinion that should be off by default.  I would think most people would want that off.  The other option I liked was the new page turn animation.  I stumbled across it by accident and it is off by default, I really think that should be on.  It is found by, when reading a book, tap the top edge of the screen and then tap the font symbol ""Aa"" and then tap ""More"" and then scroll down and you'll see it.  I liked it more than I expected and I really believe that should be on by default, as I believe most people would like that on as well.

    So much better than 2018
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this kindle so much. The screen is huge but it is still small and compact enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm carrying around a tablet- it still keeps the lightness and portability of a kindle. The response time on the screen is so much faster than the 2018. I would get frustrated with my old one at how slow it loaded and how many times I had to tap on something before it registered that I was touching the screen. The color is easier on your eyes while reading too. It is a little pricey, but overall all definitely worth the upgrade. Also a tip for people who experience technical difficulties, just send the Amazon customer service chat a message explaining it and they will send a new one. Don‚Äôt give something a bad review because of a defective product.

    No Longer an Easier on the Eyes Than a Computer or Tablet
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Pluses: The new Kindle has a very sharp screen, is light and comfortable to hold, ""wakes up"" easily when I open my case and preserves a charge nicely when I close it.Neutrals: pictures in grayscale are definitely sharper, but do we really need 300 dpi type for reading? Also, I prefer using a narrow column, so the additional width is wasted on me.Negatives: Alas, the modern Kindle fails in its basic task, which is to be easier on the eyes than a modern tablet or computer, no matter how many shades of 17 diode light or mango I apply. I can download a Kindle Reader app on any of them plus my phone and read at least as easily. My very old Keyboard Kindle actually had a much softer presentation, back when computers really hurt to read on.Second problem (software) is that highlighting text tends to take long to ""grab"" and sometimes brings down the preference screen instead.Third: I purchased the bundle, and I am not aware that the nine volt charger really charges much faster than the five.I will say that the Kindle keeps me from playing solitaire when I read a tough passage; I just stop and do something else productive.

Very easy on the eyes.  The touch screen is a little slower than what I'm used to, but I like the smaller size (compared to my old kindle) and I'm thrilled that I can listen to my audiobooks with Bluetooth. Perfect.

    This is my wife's second Kindle.  The first one which is about 5 or 6 years old quit charging because the bottom connector went bad. When I saw they upgraded to a USB C connector I knew it was time.  I think the old USB Micro connectors are a PIA.  Her new one is great. It synced right out of the box and connected to WiFi immediately.  The thing is perfect!  Sooo mine will arrive tomorrow.  (Been reading off an old Fire)  What bugs me are the reviewers that give this product one star because it didn't work out of the box or they were too dumb to figure it out.  If it doesn't work send it back and get another one.  It couldn't be easier with Amazon.  Giving it one star because it didn't work says nothing about a good one that does work.  I bet a bad one is one in a thousand or more.  Give it a break...just get another one.

    The photo shows 5th gen (same size as 10) vs 11th gen.The kindle has long been my favorite device. You can take my phone away, but not my kindle. I would not usually be an early adopter of the new version, but after 8 years, my old kindle finally started acting up. Overall, the gen 11 is great.Pros- Bigger is better. I can now increase the font size without reducing the words per page, which is great for older eyes.- USB-C fits either way- Adjustable background (white to amber)- Sync‚Äôing cloud content is easy- Typing and paging are slightly fasterCons (minor, but there are a few)- The power button protrudes slightly, so when I prop the kindle upright, it sometimes turns off.- Sync‚Äôing local content, if you have any, from your old Kindle is a bit time consuming.- Even with the brighter screen and adjustable warmth, the gen 11 is still not as white as my old kindle. I have brightness on max and warmth on low. Its still a very clear screen, but I would prefer a pure white background.- I would like more font choices, like Calibri.  I use Caecilia, which is fine, but not my favorite.

Now I actually have to get my glasses on just to make those simple adjustments.  They have over-thought  the improvements on these things!  Should have stayed simple.And with all this, they still haven‚Äôt come up with a remote for the darn thing.  They need to make a little device you can put on your thumb, or hand, which you can press to advance pages.  Then a person can prop up the kindle and relax, let go of it, and still use it easily.

    I had an older model (keyboard at the bottom) that worked well was easy to use.  Amazon said something about no more support.  Got the Paperwhite.  The touch screen is so touchy that sometimes when my hand passes over the screen it jumps 3 or 4 pages, the library is very difficult to use, i have downloaded books from my library on my amazon account 2 or 3 time and only 2 or 3 will make it.  I have had a great deal of difficulty removing downloads from my kindle and returning them to my amazon storage.  This has a lot of useless features, if I wanted all of that crap, I would have ordered a fire tablet or downloaded the kindle app on my tablet.  The beauty of the old unit was simplicity itself.  It was a hundred books in a light carry package, easy to use.  Every time i finish a book now it takes an hour to get rid of the old and try to find a new.  But there are lots of ads (I paid extra for no ads) for other books.  If i hadn't traded the old one I would already have it back out and using it.

    I love this Kindle - super light weight, adjustable back light, nice size... it's everything I hoped it would be.  This is a bit nitpicky but you can see in the picture how I found that I naturally want to hold the Kindle with my right hand - basically resting on my right ring finger.  Well, it didn't take very long to figure out that the power button is exactly in that spot (noted with red arrow in pic) so if I hold it like that, I am toggling the power button all the time.  It's annoying (obviously) so I've adjusted to other ways to hold the Kindle and all is wonderful.  But my instinctual way of holding it causes the power button problem.  No big deal.  Still totally worth it for me.  That small issue is what prevented a perfect 5-star rating!

Its bezel gets so thin and with the flush screen it‚Äôs just very hard to hold it tightly on one hand without accidentally touching the screen. I know we can lock the touch screen but that doesn‚Äôt solve the issue for me as when I‚Äôm holding it on one hand I can‚Äôt make a long enough swipe to turn page - I don‚Äôt have large enough hands! Then I try to use landscape mode to hold the thickest bezel while reading but that can‚Äôt be done either - the landscape mode only allows one direction, and it‚Äôs the wrong direction - meaning, if I want to hold the side of the thicker bezel with my right hand, the words would be upside down. After so many attempts I just got so angry with Amazon. Why do they have to do this to my fav paperwhite. Why I does every digital divice HAVE TO have larger screen? I just don‚Äôt see the point. Now I have to return this uncomfortable to hold kindle and buy a new one and just lose all the prime day discount  (I made my original purchase on prime day, I should‚Äôve purchased a smaller kindle that day ugh). I‚Äôm very dissatisfied with the stupid upgrade of 2021 paperwhite. I hate the thin bezel and slippery back and the larger size and heavier weight and the flush screen. I hate basically every upgrade Amazon made to the outlook of paperwhite. I really just hope I can get the old paperwhite back.

    I love the 6.8‚Äù screen for one. It is the perfect size for me and not as awkwardly shaped as Oasis (though I do miss the page turners a lot, they came in handy when I read in bed).Second, it has been over four weeks now and my battery finally went under 50%.Other than connecting to the internet to download books, I keep it on airplane mode and the brightness is usually between 3-7. I read 2-5 hours a day, more if I‚Äôm not working or doing anything. The fact that after 4 weeks, I only used half the battery life is fantastic.The page turning and time it takes to load things is far quicker than the previous paperwhite and even a little better than the Oasis.The 8gb is perfect for me. Right now I have 200 books on my kindle and I still have 5.5 gb free (after software the kindle gives you around 6 gb for books, comics, audiobooks, etc).

    This Kindle Paperwhite is everything that I loved about my older one, which I lost in a dark, muddy, rainy industrial area parking lot at work last week.  Anyway, the unit has more reading surface and is a bit lighter in weight than my old one.  With one touch, this unit linked to my home internet connection, and ALL of my books were already installed.  The only thing that may need improvement, is that the Settings could be easier accessed.  Other than that, this is a great unit

    Heading on vacation and planning to read alot.Much better than packing a dozen or more books, which is what we bought it for.  Good size, adjustable font size and type, adjustable brightness and much more.  Still trying to figure it all out.  Purchased the leather cover which was a good call.  One dislike is the on/off button is at the bottom and if your not careful you can shut it off accidently when reading.  If you read more than 1 book a month it's a good deal purchasing Kindle unlimited.

    Come on Amazon, where is the immersion reading?  As a person with ADHD and a child with ADHD we need immersion reading. Why offer a child's version without this feature too? Just crazy. Avid readers spending tons for a Kindle and ebooks and audiable should be able to use them together like on the app. I bought an eReader to be immersed and can't get the whole package deal, it's either listen OR read? Come on Amazon that's hindering accessibility to people that need it. Other than that HUGE gripe, I love the paperwhite 2021.

    This thing was a nightmare to set up. Wouldn't download my library, wouldn't read things transferred from laptop, wouldn't sync collections. Called and chatted for help several times but the ""customer service"" kept pushing me to the next person. Most likely they had no idea what to do either. Tried questions in the forum but looked like everyone had issues with it. After 2 weeks finally got everything figured out. Took numerous reboots, updating, and cursing. Finally had to send everything one at a time from my account which was a very unpleasant experience.They force you to keep the ""Home"" screen on it which I hate. There was an option to take it off but not after the update. It's nice enough now that it finally works but if the wifi hadn't gone out and the 3G cut off with my last one I would have kept that one and returned this one. The screen does look larger, closer to an actual page. And the battery keeps it's charge pretty well. My last one had started running down more quickly. Do like the ""warmth schedule"" for reading at night. Looks less harsh and doesn't mess with my eyes as much. Overall a really bad beginning that colored my view of this device. Don't know if mine was just messed up or they decided to make these things awful and full of ads as some sort of marketing ploy.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because, I can read in the dark on this kindle. I'm giving it a low rating due to the fact I cannot listen to audible book while reading kindle book at the same time. To some this may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I can read and listen simultaneously on my Samsung phone, iPad, or laptop,(or evev my daughters kindle fire); which leads to the 1st reason for a 2‚òÜ rating. I'm tired of the blue lighting on these devices hurting my eyes, and then evolving into a migraine.2nd, I am dyslexic and sometimes I don't want to deal with my own slow reading. I also have an auditory Processing Disorder, which sometimes make me hear words incorrectly. A lot of time these two learning disability & Disorder go hand in hand. But there are many other people out there with different types of learning styles that would also enjoy reading and listening at the same time. About 10 to12 years ago I had a kindle paperwhite that allowed this feature.3rd, You can only listen to audible book with Bluetooth devices. The old one I had had a speaker in the device for dual use, speaker or headset. So in summary I was very disappointed

If I want it I have to use my old Kindle. Also just to note the touch screen is too sensitive so the slightest touch turns pages. The buttons were much better.

    This is my 2nd kindle. My first kindle lasted nearly a decade. If finally died and I decided to order a new based on my positive experience. I ordered my new paper white at the end of February 2022. With the advertised long battery life, I erroneously assumed I‚Äôd have this kindle another decade or so. Sadly, now only 4 months later the battery will not charge fully. Yes, I tried various chargers and blocks and it never chargers past 85%. I read daily for about an hour and within 2 days the batteries are completely drained. So we are talking a 2 -3 hour battery life.  I doubt this kindle will last me a decade. This will be my last kindle. Buyer beware.

    This is my third Kindle Paperwhite and, unlike the preceding two, it sucks.Screen responsiveness is sluggish. I often have to tap it repeatedly to turn a page or activate an icon.Books don't automatically download when you purchase them anymore. Only the book cover shows up in your library, and you have to tap on that to initiate the full book download. If you fail to do so, and find yourself somewhere without Internet access, you will be unable to download and read your new books.The ‚ÄúRemove this sample‚Äù option in the book-cover menu seldom works. In order to delete those samples, you have to go to through six screens in Settings to access Manual Removal in Storage Options. Good luck remembering which sample you wanted to delete by the time you get there.‚ÄúRemove download‚Äù used to remove the item from your device. Now, the book cover remains on your device. Downloaded items have check marks to distinguish them from the downloads you removed, but the book covers remain in either case. Now you have books covers for items that aren't downloaded cluttering up your library.The device is too large to fit neatly into my hand like its predecessors did.Two thumbs way down.

    I do not like the new kindle white as compared to my old kindle that will no longer be able to receive new books.  What is wrong with having page turners that you click forward or backward as opposed to touch screen.  I am used to being able to switch hands on my kindle.  Now if I need to turn a page forward with my left hand, I have to cross my body to do so.  And as long as we are on the subject of turning pages, what is with this new kindle white with going either forward or backward several chapters every time you power down.  When you get back to your book, you can't tell where you are.  Plus I used to be able to move my books into different categories, like  Already Read, Good Books, Save for Next Books.  If I add a book to the Already Read category now, it still sits there in my ""Library"".  I do not delete books for any reason although some do end up being archived to Amazon's cloud.  And what is with this nonsense of purchasing a book, but it doesn't download to your kindle.  Instead of downloading a new book, just the title downloads and you have to manually check the internet connection, then check the airplane mode.  Even then any other books you have just purchased do not get downloaded at the same time as the one you are wanting to read.  I think my last rant is the way this thing lists your books.  Either it is a picture with the title and author, or a list with the title and author and some other stuff that just takes up space that I would rather have for the list of my available books to read.  This darn thing downloaded every title I have ever bought.  All 596 of them.  I am sure that most of these were archived.  Is that stupid or what!  What do I like about the kindle white?  I can adjust the size of the letters to what I prefer.  Other than that, I can not find anything else I like about this thing.  oh yes, it also eats my battery power because either I left wi-fi on or I left airplane mode off or some stupid thing.  Don't mess with the old ladies!

    3 pm today I'm enjoying my Kindle Paperwhite. (Purchased November 25, Today is May 25.) Finished my book and had some other stuff to do so I plugged it in to the charger and walked away. Purchased a new book from my desktop computer around dinner time, but didn't pick up my Kindle again until around 11 pm tonight. Hmm...no new book. Hit the sync button. Still no new book. Hold the power button and wait for the dialogue box to pop up and select ""Restart"". And that's the last thing it ever did.The screen flashes like it's attempting to reboot, but the only thing it displays is the Kindle logo with the boy reading under a tree. Every so often it'll flash again, but it never progresses further. Support tells you to hold the power button down for 40 seconds to force a restart, but there's no different result. Then they tell you to try it again with various options for plugging it in (try a different charger, try a usb port on your computer, nope...plug it back into a wall charger.) Nothing makes it respond differently. I can't even shut it off. There's another review posted by Nishan with a video of the exact same thing happening. Amazon is sending a replacement, but it's going to be a refurbished model which I'm not exactly happy about. It's probably going to be one that somebody sent back that's got the same exact problem.This worked beautifully when it worked. My favorite Kindle by far, and it did respond a lot better than my 2018 version. But if I only get 6 months out of it, it's hardly worth the purchase price and the hassle of needing to return it. If it weren't for my raging insomnia I'd swear off Kindle all together. (Different models, but I've had to replace at least 2 others over the years for weird software/hardware issues similar to this.) Unfortunately, being able to read in the dark without waking up my husband means I'm tied to these.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is much faster than my previous Paperwhite. The page illumination is impressive, very uniform and no bright / dark spots at all. However, while the larger screen is appreciated, the increase in weight is substantial making the device hard to hold in one hand for a longer period. While very long battery life is important for some, it adds a lot of weight. Maybe reducing battery capacity could cut weight somewhat ? Also, holding the device is cumbersome. It is hard to hold on the wider bottom frame section, while side frames are too thin for holding. You need big hands to hold it in one hand. Amazon, just switch to the Oasis design for all of your devices, reduce the price, problem solved.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I am visually impaired, and my present old Kindle has been sadly outdated, so I had to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô.  I chose this paper white as it promoted font changeability and accessibility options. Well, it does offer them but they are not sufficient. The screen size is small (smaller than what I anticipated from the description) the font size does not get very large, certainly not large enough, and the font options are terrible, all with a script, no sans script (which is So much easier to read with vision problems) and they are all hard to read with poor vision.  I am very disappointed, and may have to return.  I will give it a try to see if I can make it work.  I do think it could be a good option for someone else, without visual impairment.  I want my old Kidnle to work!Update:  I wrote the previous in frustration, which I still have, albeit waning.  They do, actually, have sans script but it  (clearly) was hard to tell the difference., and only have a few style options (maybe 8).  Directly following this review, I received a phone call from Amazon. They sent me info on how to change font, etc, which I already had done.  My issue seems to be this: this machine can hold thousands of books which can be downloaded in seconds each, yet the font size only goes up to a small size.  I would think that the font size could be adjusted for those of us with very low vision. In researching this product, i read the font could get ‚Äòhuge‚Äô, a selling point, but no, it can‚Äôt.  Too bad, it‚Äôs an easy thing to fix!  As a person who can no longer read regular books, I am not alone in requiring such technology, and large font is not too much to ask on such items, I do not believe.

    This kindle is decidedly the best one yet. Words are clear, page turns are quick, and the warm light is SO useful.

The keyboard is not that responsive and I have to type much slower than usual so the kindle can keep up. This would easily be solved by a faster processor - and I‚Äôm surprised this decision wasn‚Äôt taken.

Really?  Get a user experience expert for review of gui changes please.This should have been a 5 review.

    I was unaware that a new Kindle was coming so soon and had recently purchased a replacement for my last generation Kindle that started running very slowly. I was able to do a trade in and get a gift card so I upgraded. It was worth it!The battery life is much better than even my Kindle purchased in July. I like the bigger screen and the reaction time is better. The warm light is a great feature for someone like me who hates bright screens and uses all devices on the lowest possible brightness setting.I have had many Kindles and always like to have the most recent one. This was the first one that was actually worth the upgrade.

    It‚Äôs extremely unfortunate that Amazon is charging $120+ for a device that does not offer color and a lagging touch screen. The technology in my 2022 kindle is no different than my kindle from 10 years ago. The touch screen is less than sensitive, lags, and doesn‚Äôt register half the time. Seriously overpriced.

    The next software update may get it another star
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update: I'm taking away one more star, down to 3. The software is worse than I initially thought. Every now and then, when I try to turn the page, it freezes. After a few more tries, 30 seconds later, it unfreezes and reacts to all those page turns, forcing me to go back several pages until I find my place againOverall a very nice reader, nicer than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th GenerationThey keep advertising ""10 weeks of battery life"", which is meaningless. I wish they advertised how many hours one can read on a battery charge. I see no evidence that the battery lasts longer than the old one, plus it depends on how bright I make the backlight. With the way I have mine set up, I get about 30 hours of readingThey made the display bigger by making the bezel narrower, but that also causes a major problem, at least for me. The way I usually hold it, my fingers are on the back, supporting the weight, and my thumb is on the bezel, providing the balance. With the narrower bezel, this causes inadvertent page turns, which is extremely annoying. The good news is that this problem can probably be fixed through a software update, by adding half an inch of guard band (i.e. a region that ignores finger touches) at the left and right edges (excluding the top corners, which have special functions)

    This is my first Kindle, so no comparisons. Just an evaluation.I like this reader. Compact (hold with one hand), light weight, great resolution, the ligthting is even and adjusts well, the warm color is good for night reading, The responses are fast enough. Basic reading is not a lot of touches/clicks, so response time is fine. (Page turns seem as fast as physical book page turns). Battery life is more than enough.The basic experience is smooth. Pretty well uncluttered. As advertised.Spent extra to not get the ads. And a fabric case. The case feels good.Now it is how it behaves over the long term. No negatives yet.

    Extremely disappointed after using my newest model PW for a day. Yes, screen borders smaller but that makes hard to hold w/out accidentally touching edge and fwd/rev page when didnt want to! Have to figure out how many pp it jumped! And w/out the beveled edge, seems nowhere to grip device and it is slippery to slip out of grasp making more likely to drop. I don‚Äôt want a cover and haven‚Äôt needed one w 2 past models (7th gen and PW 7th gen). And the ON button, while located in same place as my prev models, sticks out from edge more and gets pushed w slightest of pressure. Can‚Äôt prop it up for hands free, if holding it ever-so-carefully where you dont accidentally touch borders and skip pages then only place to grip it is about the bottom and the button gets pushed and shuts it off mid-read!!  Gave up reading in bed last night after all the page turns and hand just barely touching the On/Off button too many times. Did not pay extra for Ad Free‚Ä¶it is horrible to pay for something but cant get away from annoying ads. I expect to see the cover of current book when i turn on my kindle, NOT ads for something else. Organization of books is also a negative and awful.  I will be returning this asap‚Ä¶.disappointed. Come on Amazon! This was a big step backwards.

    I wanted to get back into reading so decided to get a Kindle. Started researching the different options, and read rumors of a new device possibly being released soon. Couple days later this one was announced. I immediately pre-ordered it and received it today.After getting it registered and setup, I wanted to remove the special offers. (When I pre-ordered, the ad free version had a delivery date in November, but ad supported version Oct 27th. Weird.) Had a bit of an issue getting them removed, but Amazon customer support got it fixed for me in no time.While going through the settings, I came across a feature I didn't even know was available. Page turn animation. It might use a bit more power, but I love this feature!The lighting is really awesome. With the right combination of brightness and warmth, it looks exactly like the page of a real book. Glad I waited and got this device!

The addition of dark mode is also a nice addition.  The battery life has been great so far.  For the price its a solid deal for those in the Kindle ecosystem.  Would have loved a color eink screen, but it seems that the technology isnt quite there yet.  Will be curious to see how they improve the Oasis now that the Paperwhite has almost identical features (minus the physical keys.)

She walked me through a couple of possible fixes which apparently worked.I am impressed with Amazons customer care and happy with my new Kindle.I have used Kindle's for years and thought I would like this new one but I am finding it very frustrating. The page ""turns"" to the next page by touching the screen on either side. So, if I want to advance to the next page, I touch the right side of the screen. The problem is that very often it advances several pages so that I lose my place and I have to backtrack to find the page it should have just turned to.Also, the device just turns itself off at random times while I am reading, even though the battery level shows to be above 80%. At this point I am considering returning the device and reading on my phone.

    As a Kindle owner for many years (I‚Äôve had several others before this one.) I must say that the Kindle Paperwhite (11th generation) ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù are not what they should be. Purchased new books and accessing the ones you already have purchased is not the simple task that Kindle is known for. Just holding this version by either side while reading can cause it to flip to other pages than the one you are reading. It is also very easy to turn it off by accident. Another issue comes up if you need to go to another part of a book as the new feature for this does not work very well. I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit with my finger pressed on the spot for an extended time to get it to respond. All in all I‚Äôm wishing I had my old Kindle back.

    New, larger screen size means not having to turn the page as often (and that's a good thing).  The larger screen does not, however, mean that it is heavier to hold (and that, too, is a good thing).  I am so far, very happy with my new Paperwhite.UPDATE: I'm downgrading my original 5 star review to 3 stars.  All of the above remarks still hold true BUT I am now having a huge, annoying problem turning the page. I find that instead of turning to the next page the Kindle, in it's infinite wisdom, will sometimes forward 2 or 3 pages ahead (while with some books this may be a blessing I would like to be the one that makes that choice). I am seriously considering going back to my old, smaller Paperwhite for a less frustrating read!SECOND UPDATE.  The page turning problem has become worse and seriously interrupts the flow while reading.  If I hadn‚Äôt passed the point of no return this sucker would be going back to Amazon .

    Right out of the box, I hate it. I have a 3rd generation Kindle that I bought in 2011 and I have almost 600 books in it. It still works great, the battery charges and lasts for days. All the buttons still work, the screen and cover are in perfect condition. That's 10 great years, and I am an avid reader!So you may wonder why I bought this new Kindle Paperwhite.  Well, I live in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and the power goes out quite often in the winter. I like to dive under the covers to stay warm and read, but when it gets dark, the old Kindle has no light. That is the one and only reason I got the new Paperwhite; so I can read during power outage.The Paperwhite has a very thin frame so I can't hold it without touching the screen. So that is awkward since I have to move my thumb to read under it.I absolutely hate the touch screen; it is very difficult to navigate and does not always respond when I ""tap"" or ""swipe"" and the screen gets fingerprints and smears. I like the navigation buttons and keyboard on the old Kindle.The Paperwhite will stay in the bedside drawer until the lights go out. It works for that.

    I was unable to use my kindle when the battery ran out. None of the connectors I ordered fit so I was left with no reader.The return was easy , but I was disappointed when it was replaced with a refurbished reader

    I have owned multiple kindles since 2016. The last one the 10th generation was AWFUL. This model is way better they have seemed to improved all the issues from the 10th generation and it‚Äôs a great kindle so far ! The battery life is pretty good . Reading about 3 hours a day my battery lasts about a week and a half to two weeks. The warm light feature is great as well. So far I have been very happy with this kindle !

    The new 11th Generation Kindle Paperwhite now requires a USB-C cable.  During the ordering, that was never an option, just to add a Power adaptor.I was totally surprised when I went to charge this new Kindle with my previous cable. Nope.  I called Amazon and was told, Yes, they now require a USB-C Cable.  It would have been nice to know that upfront

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I don't know if anyone is even paying attention at Amazon anymore. this is just a 6 inch build with a giant chin. flat screen nice but shows fingerprints and smudges like crazy I'm using a microfiber cloth several times a day to wipe it of. faster page turn then the 10th gen 6 inch yes but not the oasis I bought on ebay for 60 dollars. Battery life is worse the the 10th and 9th gen that you can read 9 or 10 books on I got 7 books out of this new one. you get pop up windows saying application closing or application not working. still the same multi touch operating system that's more of a pain to use then a android tablet with the multi taps to do everything including the book mark. Kobo and nook single tap book mark. I bought my first kindle in 2010 a 3rd gen with keyboard it died last year and I hate all the kindles after the kindle touch because of the cheap build and rotten OS. the thing making this the end for me is the minute plus download speeds of books when nook and kobo take 2 to 3 seconds. I bought a Kobo clara HD 3 weeks ago and between its easy to use picture perfect operating system and in the library section you can hit 3 dots pull up a menu that says download all. Kindle makes my life hard and makes me want to pull my hair out, so I'm going to Kobo where I enjoy  picking up their Reader and using it.  I'm cancelling my kindle unlimited subscription because I don't want anything to do with kindle anymore. evidently some one's more interested in shooting his rear into orbit on a P n s rocket then making sure kindle makes good readers.

    I have Nook and the Kindle 8th generation which both have a frame around with the screen recessed in the center. This Kindle 11th generation is all flat surface like a tablet. I just like it very much. Kindle has smoother and faster page scrolling and turning compared to the nook glowlight which blinks and pauses before it opens, same as their very first e-ink version. I like the amber light in both nook and kindle (and cellphone). I know I bought it brand new, out of a sealed box, but this Kindle sign in asked for a guy's name, as if it was pre-owned. Other than that weirdness, I enjoy it.

    Piece of junk
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is a great reading device - when it works. As a few other reviewers mentioned, it will often freeze up. You get a warning that it‚Äôs going to happen because the page turns get slower and slower; there‚Äôs a palpable and annoying delay before the page finally turns, which then leads to a complete freeze up. There is absolutely no choice except to reboot it entirely. This would be great, but this problem is it‚Äôs fatal flaw.UPDATE:  The very next day after this review was posted, I received a call regarding my negative review from an Amazon Outreach Support Representative. She patiently and professionally guided me through performing a factory reset and creating a new Amazon account. This took awhile due to my continual errors in doing so. The representative was very polite and kind and was dedicated to resolving the problem. Now my PaperWhite is functioning flawlessly. Not only do the pages now turn easily but I noticed that now the battery lasts significantly longer. Thanks to this representative and the now perfect functionality of my Kindle, I find it reasonable to upgrade my review to five stars.Update number 2:  I now must return to my original review. It IS a piece of junk. I was just in the middle of reading a book when the entire screen went blank. I had to restart it twice and went to a different page rather then the page on which I was reading. I would give this one star except that it works most of the time; nevertheless, this is extremely annoying, frustrating, and interferes with the joy of reading. There is no reasonable explanation to why this happens.

    The Machine Is Fine When It Is Not Freezing.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This machine is a very good e-reader, but there is a problem with the hardware/software.  Mine froze in complete nonuse twice.  The second time may be related to new firmware Amazon put out and withdrew.  Amazon acted well in replacing my first reader and is in the process of replacing my second, but this freezing problem has to be resolved if this product is going to be popular with the general consumer, regardless of the large number of good reviews.  Other snags include the invalid certificate box coming up 3 times every time prior to accessing wikipedia and an updating notice every time I access the store.  The machine also slows down sometimes and even more prior to freezing. Amazon's software people need to correct their mistakes.  Once Amazon corrects these problems, this product will deserve five stars.  But when I receive my second replacement, I will, while enjoying my reading, fear a third freeze.  A third freeze and I will suffer post-traumatic stress reading disorder.

    So Not Happy
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After having to send in my older, fully-functional Kindle Paperwhite 2018 to get the 20% trade-in on this new device, I found myself without a Kindle for a little while. So, I was so excited when this finally came today! Especially since when you purchase it, you get 4 months free of Kindle Unlimited. I really wanted to get started reading on the new Kindle and make good use of my subscription.Well, sad day, this is how my Kindle looked when I received it and tried to power it on. I already traded in my old Kindle, have a free Kindle Unlimited subscription, and well, no functional Kindle to read on.I had to spend my free time today contacting Amazon to arrange for a replacement to be sent, and the fastest they can replace this is FIVE more days even with my Prime subscription. So there go another 5 days of not using the Kindle Unlimited or getting the joy of reading a book in the evenings.Oh, and I get to be the one to have to make a trip to UPS to return the non-functional Kindle. How convenient.Apparently, this device is not well-made, and let's just say, I'm not pleased. I wish I had NEVER traded in my older Kindle!UPDATE: They sent me a REFURBISHED Kindle rather than a new replacement. What on earth?????!!!!! I even specifically asked customer service if the replacement would be new rather than refurbished and they promised me it would be new because it arrived not functional and was within the 30-day window. Called customer service and they said they would send a new one, but it was on back order.UPDATE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE LAST UPDATE: Well, received what I thought would finally be my new Kindle after almost 2 months. No joke, another refurbished one. Called customer service again and maybe they will figure this out this time around. How hard is it to get the NEW KINDLE that I paid for???

    Tree Screen...Known Problem...Don't buy!!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I very rarely review products, especially a crappy one. This one however, isn't okay. I bought mine back in January (not even 6 months ago) brand new for $130. I have been a long time Nook user. I've been having an issue with viewing a regular screen so I figured if I was going to purchase an e-reader and not a tablet-esqu one, I might as well go with Amazon for Kindle Unlimited as using my library apps seemed complicated. From the beginning, I had odd issues and just thought it was an inferior product because it was just an e-reader and nothing fancy. Sometimes my books just wouldn't download. No biggie. I then noticed my Kindle quit saving at the right place. Sometimes a page or two behind or sometimes chapters behind. I have the Kindle app on my phone and even though I don't really read on my phone anymore, thought maybe the two were just interfering with each other. I got over it. About two weeks ago, I was trying to download books and I was getting an application error. I thought maybe it was my wifi. I literally just kept figuring it was quirky and an e-reader... Now, last night, I got the page with the tree and person and it literally just keeps rebooting that screen every 15-20 seconds. It's been doing this for the past 24 hours. I can't just hold the button for 45 seconds and looking it up...it appears MANY people have had this issue and it's to do with the software. I did nothing to it. It ""lives"" in the side pocket of my daughter's nursery glider because I read it at night when I'm up with her. From what I read, most people are either offered to buy a new one for like $80 or they are told nothing can be done if there's no warranty. I do not have a warranty but I'm not dishing out another $80 to Amazon for the same product to break again. I'll be calling Customer Service tomorrow but judging from all the forums online, they'll use tech speak and then tell me nothing can be done. Even people WITH a warranty are simply being given refurbished ones after promised a new replacement...some already broken upon arrival. I REALLY expected better from the Kindle line. At this point, I'll take a generic, basic e-reader over taking the chance of this happening again.

    I used Amazon's trade in and got a good price on this Kindle. I upgraded from a 6th generation. My 6th generation was in excellent condition, so I didn't really need a new Kindle but the trade in was a good incentive. I like the larger screen because I read a lot. I like the fact that I can set the warm light to turn on and off at a certain time. I just wish Amazon would come out with a better quality leather cover.

    I got this Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and I was coming from a kindle 8th generation..what an upgrade! I absolutely love this kindle. I was t sure how I would like the backlight. One of the reasons I bought the original kindle was because it read like a book. But not I don‚Äôt know how I ever went without a backlight. You can adjust the brightness and you can also go to warm and dark mode. The battery life is excellent. I also love the flush design and bigger screen. If you are looking to upgrade but are on the fence‚Ä¶just do it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

    Hi everyone,so I'm a voracious reader and have at least a thousand books on my kindles.  I actually own 3, all synced together because I travel a ton and keep one in my travel bag. I stays on my nightstand and one is at the office.  All 3 are the paperwhite models.  I really have loved them.  Anyway, I get this model as soon as it came out.  It has some strange hang ups, like when I step away for a bit and it goes into sleep mode or close the cover, and when I return and swipe to turn it on, it goes to a page between 50 and 100 pages back, so then of course I have to search for where I was.  It's extremely annoying and my 2 other kindles have not done this. There is no option that says return to the last page read or something like that.  This is driving me crazy.  Anyway, yesterday it completely froze.  So of course I pushed and held the power button to restart it.  I did this and it came back on eventually but frozen to the scene with the boy reading against the tree.  I can't get past this.  I tried to restart it and it does nothing.  I tried plugging it in to the power cable and still nothing.  It is charged to about 40%.  I called customer service and after about 30 MINUTES trouble shooting,  they said they would process the return and exchange for a new one, but that it would come in 3 days.  I don't understand why the delay.  I'm in the hospital and literally have nothing to do because I only love to read in my free time. I don't watch tv and can't read on my phone for hours because it's not comfortable, which is why I have 3 kindles and also it depletes my phone battery.Anyway, after explaining all this to the rep, they said they would ask a lead about giving me some kind of compensation (anything) because of the inconvenience. He then said he would have to get back to me the next day.  I got an email from amazon regarding the issue but it didn't say anything about the resolution, so I  had to call them again.  And finally they said they can't do anything because they had processed the exchange, as if they were doing me a favor, when it has a year warranty and I got it at the end of october.  Thus it's totally under warranty and therefore they have to replace it because it's defective.  Honestly this whole experience has left me with such a bad taste that I'm actually considering canceling my prime membership.  Stay clear is my recommendation and avoid both Amazon and their products because they are not what they used to be, both in quality and customer service.

But wait, if I buy clothes, that will come with air bubbles to protect it. HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENCE?? I asked customer service to send me one with something to protect the item.If it freezes one more time then I will return it and buying at a physical store.My old kindle that I have had for 2 years never froze.Apart from those 2 negative things, I think it‚Äôs great but I just have a bad feeling that it‚Äôs not that great of a device and will buy insurance. I only bought this because of the dark and yellow light options it has. Other wise I don‚Äôt recommend this new version.

    I‚Äôve had multiple kindle paper whites over the years and while I have loved the convenience of them over having to buy physical books, the screen backlight has always bothered me. The 10th generation was horrible and there was a ton of blue light so reading at night was not the most enjoyable. When I saw this new version coming out, I was excited that it looked like they had finally fixed my number one complaint. This thing is amazing! If you have an old version, it is worth trading in and upgrading if you have a similar complaint. I love that you can adjust the warmth and the screen is slightly bigger as well. So glad I made the switch.

    A couple of steps forward
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have owned two Kindles prior to buying this one: Paperwhite (2015) and Kindle 4. Kindle 4 still remains my favorite all around e-reader. In retrospect, I really liked having a non-touch screen. The downside of Kindle 4 was that it was slow and I couldn't read in the dark. The Paperwhite (2015) was an improvement over that mainly because now I could read in the dark. The touch screen added a bit of ease of use but annoyance with every touch being an interaction. Still, I told myself that if Amazon added warm light and a USB-C to the Paperwhite, I would buy it. So I bought this one.And really, those two features are the two big steps forward for this device. It also feels faster than my Paperwhite 2015 so that doesn't hurt either. The downside for this device is that now with the flush screen and smaller bezels, the touch sensitive area is even bigger. I had too many unintended touches on this device. It's also a little bit bigger; so with small bezels all around, it's just generally less uncomfortable to hold. This was the least comfortable kindle I have had.I also typically keep my device on airplane mode unless I need to connect to my Amazon account. This device froze frequently while I was reading. I suspect this has to do with telemetry and ads being pulled to the device. In airplane mode, the device just freezes and lags if it can't communicate with Amazon servers. This is just my guess but I have seen this behavior in games in both iOS and Android platforms where if you block their access to the internet, the games lags heavily and once you restore internet access, the game play is smooth again.So generally, this is a good step forward for Amazon. I suspect that Amazon is expanding its ads business and the integration of that into the kindle OS is causing lags on the device when in airplane mode. That's definitely a step backwards. Add to that a bigger device that is less comfortable to hold and the choice was clear for me.I am sending this device back and keeping my Paperwhite 2015.

    Over the years kindle has proven itself to be a great product. The Paperwhite is the best yet. Finally a faster chip and more space 8 gigs holds a lot of books.Processor is still not fast.However I still like Oasis with the push buttons the best.I would recommend the Kindle Paperwhite.

    This is a pretty nice improvement on size and screen quality over the earlier model. If you have the one before it, you probably don‚Äôt need this one but you certainly will notice the upgrade. It also has night time lighting. Go with the 8 gig and not the 32 gig unless you just have to listen to audio books from your kindle. Your smartphone is usually a much better option for audio books.

Its easy to read while walking on the treadmill.  With the Libby app, its so easy to download books from the library.  Keeps you place in the book between reading sessions.

    A great update marred by a soft/fuzzy screen
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    While this Kindle Paperwhite 2021 finally brings a whole host of long needed improvements, the likes of which competitor Kobo has offered for years and at various price points, it‚Äôs not without its flaws.For starters the overall footprint of the device has increased despite room enough to fit the larger 6.8‚Äù display within the footprint of the former body. While it‚Äôs not a deal breaker it hurts portability and single-hand use that little bit. The latter is especially noticeable because, unlike it‚Äôs pricier sibling the Oasis, it lacks an asymmetric grip and page turn buttons.While the resolution of the new display is the same 300 PPI, I encountered noteworthy issues with display sharpness when compared to the 2018 model. As pictured (to the best of my ability) my new model lacks sharpness and contrast all around the edges and in particular on the left side which results in a soft almost fuzzy lack of crispness to all text or images.To make matters worse the consistency of this issue varies wildly across the display. In the image you can almost make out the random diagonal plane of sharpness towards the center of the display. This means that you find yourself consistently reminded how soft the fuzzy portions are compared to the properly sharp portions.I‚Äôm thrilled to see Amazon finally include USB-C and warm-light adjustment, but I find it especially hard to look past the display issues on a device expressly built for reading. If you have the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis I‚Äôd recommend holding off for now or consider a Kobo equivalent model with native OverDrive support for library borrowing.

    Frustrates Reading
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Feels like I'm reading through a foggy haze. The text is not crisp, the brightest color is too ""warm,"" and for indoors reading the Paperwhite is greatly inferior to a tablet or, for that matter, a smart phone. Reading outdoors on a bright day, however, it truly has no equal.The design engineers must have failed to try it out before production, because if one tries to hold the Paperwhite with one hand, while reading, you soon discover you frequently touch the power button and turn off your reader. The button should have been located on the top or upper side of the device.When holding the device with one hand, and advancing the pages using a thumb swipe, the book will skip backwards three pages. Whereas this doesn't happen too frequently, it does happen often enough to be extremely annoying.The two outstanding features of the Paperwhite are its long battery life and bright light functionality. It flat blows away the other e-reader devices in those two areas.Bottom line - I wouldn't recommend buying the Kindle Paperwhite unless you do a lot of reading outside in bright sunlight and/or read for hours at a time and don't want to keep your tablet/smart phone plugged in to the charger.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Almost loved it. I thought that this would probably be one of the best iterations of the Paperwhite ever. I had the 2012/2013 version and loved that one! I had it by my side all the time, used it for years without issue (though I will admit it did lag occasionally). But this new one, despite its glowing features that led me to buy it, including the warm light and waterproof/water resistant nature (not that this second feature matters -- because my old Kindle Paperwhite and my standard Kindle handle splashes just fine), was an utter disappointment. I bought it mainly for the warm light feature so that reading before bed doesn't disrupt sleep quite as much, but given that I have bought it for such a feature, it had limited use (staying in the bedroom and only used for times when I read immediately before bed). Well, I bought it in October, only finished a grand-total of one full novel on it and only used it for roughly a hand-full of times, and it already has an issue. Stuck on the boot screen, unable to fully boot in or turn off (holding the power button for however long (40 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) doesn't work, neither does charging). The customer service is okay... if you get the right person... but to be honest, at this point, I feel that the replacement device isn't worth my time. I am not looking forward to dealing with the problem a second time and I can read hours before sleep instead with much more reliable Kindles.Do not recommend.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm a pretty avid reader and I didn't hesitate to buy the Voyage when it came out But for the first time in 10 years of reading on kindles, I'm considering a return. The device is great, don't get me wrong. The material its made of makes holding it feel natural, the screen is excellent (although the voyage remains the sharpest screen to date) and I enjoy the size increase. But many small things have just come together to really annoy me.For starters, the device freezes on a regular basis usually after adjusting font/brightness and returning to the book. Sometimes it unfreezes after a bout 20 seconds sometimes it never does. I've had the device a few days but its happened almost a dozen times. I thought my issues would be over when I updated the firmware but that not only didnt help, but introduced a new bug where the backlight does not turn off when locking the device, and made some nonsense changes to the interface. List view went from 7-8 books to 5. For those with a big library, that makes it very painful to view everything (and nothing has been added to the value of the list view, same data just unnecessarily bigger. Why not leave the option for fitting more books in the list?)The power button is on the bottom. I've accidentally turned my device off while reading many times considering that the larger form factor requires cradling on my fingers at times. Curious placement. I've tried to remove special offers but for three days now it just says ""sorry something went wrong, please try again later"". My kindle is a place where I go to get away from everything else, not be advertised to. After this bug I researched the issue and other people are being told that they aren't allowed to remove ads. That's disappointing.I know it sounds nitpicky, but a great device has just been crippled with strange bugs, unusual design choices and software updates that don't really add value and seem to just be changing things for the sake of changing things, or changing things for the wrong reasons. For the first time in my life after owning kindles for ten years, I'm considering returning it.

    I got the newest (11th Gen) paperwhite to upgrade from my older (2014) paperwhite.  I like the display and ability to have warmer light.However if I do not use the device for several hours it seems to go into deep sleep and it takes about 3s to wake up (displays a message that it is starting up) before I get the ""swipe to unlock"" message, whereas the older device started within 1s. In addition, the new device appears to have a shorter battery life that the old one (even after 7 years of use...)Finally the new device sometime skips pages when I swipe to go to the next page, which is not a problem I ever had with the older device.In all the new device is nice, display and background light warmth is improved, but it may be trying to be too smart and do too much, which leads to usability glitches that make me rate it only 3 stars.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    For those of us with poor vision, the ability to increase the font size makes the Kindle indispensable.  There's just one problem: this applies only to the contents of the e-books themselves, so it can still be hard to navigate the system to do things like search your library, or change a Kindle setting.or read a book review, for example.  This is why I took a star away from ""Easy to read.""  I would urge the designers to address this accessibility issue.  It doesn't seem that difficult.

    I do most of my reading in bed in a very dark room to help me sleep.  I tried all of the brightness, font, warmth settings I could, as well as dark mode, but I couldn't find a decent configuration that was comfortable.  The dark mode has a gray background and text that isn't bright enough which leads to terrible contrast.  And the only way to get decent contrast with the normal/light mode was to turn the brightness up to a setting that is uncomfortable for my eyes.This reader is okay if you plan to read in normal lighting but I do not recommend for dark rooms.  My android phone with a Kindle app, black page color, and eye comfort shield is vastly superior and more comfortable on my eyes.

The touchscreen still isn't on par with that of a phone or tablet, but the amount of unregistered taps has been reduced, and the accuracy of selecting text is much better. I read a lot at night in the dark, so the warm light is what I notice most. I have much less eye fatigue when comparing the warm yellow light of this new paperwhite to the whitish blue light of the old.

    The buggiest Kindle ever!
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This Kindle drives me crazy. It freezes so I can't turn pages at least once or twice a day (I read maybe 3 hours a day) and has to be rebooted in order to function again, which takes maybe 5 minutes each time.. Sometimes when I go to the top to get a menu, it does not work, or the menu comes up but menu items such as table of contents will not come up or only come up after being touched 5 or 6 times and after a delay of a minute or so. Frequently after I close down and come back later the display will be not where I left off but a couple of chapters or more behind where I left off and I have to hunt for my current location (not easy when I can't get the table of contents to display either).I only bought this Kindle because my old paperwhite would no longer hold a charge, but I sadly miss my old reader. It had none of these problems and gave me many happy, trouble-free hours of reading. This new one is so SO much inferior in almost every way. This current one is called 11th generation Paperwhite, Firmware Version 5.14.1.1. I do not recommend it!

    Power button placement is idiotic
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    You will occasionally and accidentally turn the Kindle off in the middle of reading if you:- rest the device against a table- rest it against a belt buckle or a shirt button- place it on a stand- move a finger along the bottom- change your grip by supporting the bottom of the device- etc.This is such an elementary issue, I can only imagine how embarrassed the Paperwhite product manager must be for not user testing the device enough in real life contexts.Other than this obvious oversight it's a great device. The screen is beautiful. However, I'm returning mine due to the design problem. It's also slower to wake up than my Kindle Voyage, which I'll stick to for now (I've never before seen a Kindle that tells the user ""Waking up..."" when swiping to open it -- odd 1-2 seconds of extra sluggishness there).

    Don't like anything about new Paperwhite...VERY disappointed
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After many years of being satisfied with my Nook tablet, I was excited to purchase the newest Kindle Paperwhite in order to get Amazon e-reader books.  I'm so disappointed that I wasted my money.  It's hard to navigate, it's touchy, the screen always seems blurry no matter what light setting I put it on, and I absolutely loathe the gray and white (not black and white) pictures of the books.  They are not clear and difficult to see.  Until I can be convinced that there are better Kindles, I'll stick with my ancient tablet.

    Very disappointing
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù light is the most ridiculous and irritating feature to be put on this reader.  It constantly turns itself from black and white to yellow and has to be adjusted, often multiple times to return it to black and white. Why would whoever designed this think anyone would want to read on a yellow background?  Additionally, when you purchase or borrow a book it does not show up automatically in the library as it used to.  You now have to make sure you remember or make a note of the name and ‚Äúsearch Kindle‚Äù for it.  Expected my new Paperwhite would have improvements but disappointed in this expectation.  Would definitely not buy this Paperwhite again!

    It's a well buily e-reader. But I still don't like how much empty space Kindle leaves around each word. It's a small screen be compact.The usability is awful. Too many buttons and unnecessary options/gestures. I want a clean reading experience as much as possible, a book. Not a eink tablet. Don't try to be fancy. Also Kindle seems try to lure you to their store as much as possible. Please allow users to hide store search bars and etc. Also please allow show books by list instead of their covers.  If not for the Kindle book store I would easily switch back to Kobo. Kobo is much cleaner.Oh please support epub.Battery life felt smaller than my kindle gen 2 or 3. But this is subjective.

    Great looking Kindle with serious reliability issues
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Quick summary: This Kindle provides a lovely reading experience, but has software issues; I'm on my second replacement.I‚Äôve been reading on Kindles since 2009. The 6.8"" version of the Kindle Paperwhite is my 4th Kindle, so I typically have Kindles them for about 2-3 years before getting sucked in by a shiny new model. Usually, my old Kindle is still functioning fine at that point, and I hand it down to one of my kids.The 6.8‚Äù Kindle paperwhite has been a stark departure from the reliability I‚Äôm used to. I received one as a Christmas gift in 2021, and was initially very happy. I love the design updates, the wider screen, and the warmth screen features. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the size (a little too big to hold comfortably), but that problem is easily solved with a case or a pop socket.After about two months of reading, my book froze. I went to the home screen to discover my library had disappeared (still in Amazon, just gone from the Kindle). I attempted to reboot, and the Kindle got stuck in an endless reboot cycle. It would load up to the screen with the tree, freeze (it never showed the progress bar), shut itself off, and try to restart again‚Ä¶ until the battery ran out.I called Amazon customer service in late February and had outstanding help. I returned my broken Kindle, received a replacement, and was once again happily reading. The replacement worked for about 1.5 months until one night my book froze and‚Ä¶ I had another endlessly rebooting Kindle. The exact same problem.I contacted customer service again in May and asked to return the Kindle, planning to buy an older model with the refund. I was told I was out of the 30 day return window, and all they could offer was a replacement.I appreciate the second replacement, which is on its way, but now every time I‚Äôm reading I‚Äôll be wondering if this is the day my book freezes and I'm on the phone with customer service again...

    This is an amazing tool for my son who loves to read.  I wanted to give him unfettered access to books with out the internet and traditional tablet apps.  he needs access to books beyond Harry Potter or kids books. I removed the web browser and gave him the device with the ability to download what ever books he wanted. That was A mistake. He rented pornographic comics and books.  I wish I could restrict access to pornography but still let him access Everything else. In the mean time I have locked down access to all on the Kindle content and we spend time choosing books together to download.  One other unfortunate side effect is the platform now keeps suggesting inappropriate content.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    There is apparently no way to NOT see other household member audible books in your library. That means that you have potentially tons of books that you need to scroll through to find the one you want, because you cannot remove anything from a family household, nor sort anything.Update: Looks like there is a way, but if sharing was enabled prior to getting your kindle, disabling sharing is not sufficient. You need to completely delete title by title, disable family sharing, leave the household, then re-join the household, reset the kindle and re-login.Thats 2 hours of my life I won't get back.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I traded in my Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen for a new 2021 Paperwhite model due to my older model battery starting to need more frequent charges.I found that the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite was a little too large and heavy for comfort.  I purchased as light a case as possible, but it still was more of a challenge for my arthritic hands.  I also found that the page responsiveness was not as good as advertised. I missed my smaller, older 7th Gen model.A recommendation to Amazon - for your slightly older Paperwhite customers - keep the size and weight of your product smaller, please.  The regular Kindle is smaller, but the benefits of the Paperwhite are attractive to alot of customers.

    *EDITED* to add that as of yesterday, the Kindle no longer functions. It seems to have tried to install an update, and is now stuck on the ‚ÄúKindle‚Äù Home Screen with the logo, and every attempt to hard restart the device only results in a cycling of the Home Screen. I‚Äôm not able to unlock it or do anything else with it. Thankfully, Amazon warranty has promised to send me a new device, so here‚Äôs to hoping that the Kindle I received was simply bugged out and the replacement works as promised.This gist: the Kindle Paperwhite has done everything I would expect a ""basic"" Kindle to do, but isn't worth the extra money.Pros: I can read e-books, which saves me money and space in my apartment.Cons:- the pages turn in flickers/flashes, and only sometimes land me on the next or previous page- the transition from light to dark mode is discombobulating, with another series of flickers or flashes and sometimes freezing on the drop down menu- I have yet to experience the battery life lasting past a week, let alone the promised 10 weeks- recently, when I try to resume reading, the Kindle drops me to a random spot in the book rather than resuming where I left offNot impressed, and I will be seeking to replace the Kindle with the basic version to save myself money and expectations.

So I arranged for another trade in. When they returned the kindle to me they did so with an adapter and cord, that were not mine. I included a note stating that fact. I just checked my account and they dropped the value from 20$ to 15$/working. Like I said above you can actually resell mine as new. No scratches no issues it was in mint condition.The new kindle:I am having a hard time with the lack of sensitivity to touch. Not as responsive as my previous. Battery life is not as indicated.

    I was extremely excited for a new Kindle and have been waiting for a month+.  However, the upgrade was not worth it and I returned.  I had an older Kindle Paper White that I love and will keep using.  Here were some of the reasons for return:1)  The wider screen, even while minimal, made it very uncomfortable to hold with one hand2)  I could see shadows from the previous page after a turn3)  The brightness just seemed off.  I could not get it to be on the perfect setting where it was crisp and visible without looking like a normal tablet4)  The menu configuration made it multiple clicks/swipes to get to brightness vs. the older model where one push gets you there.

    Firstly, the matt screen works well for readability. Glare is significantly reduced from my other Kindles (I have 7). However, the placement of the control buttons and charging port on the bottom is just stupid. It means anytime I try to stand it on a reading support, it wants to shut down or reset. Also when stood vertically, the charging port is inaccessible. Too, many of the touch screen motions are different than all other Kindles - WHY??? I enjoy reading outdoors, so to that end, the paperwhite is an upgrade. I really want to like it, but except for outdoor reading, I simply cannot.

    This Kindle is light and fast and the page warmth is a great touch. Some reviewers have lamented the long wake up time. Since I'm probably not going to use it as an emergency medical device or a defensive weapon during a surprise ambush I think waiting 10 seconds to read is ok.

    Slow and glitchy and disconnects from wifi
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I find that it is very slow and doesn‚Äôt always respond to what I try to do. I sometimes have to click five times to open a book. It looks like it‚Äôs loading then it stops.  Sometimes when I go to the next page it will jump forward or backwards multiple pages, or it will go back and fourth between the same two pages while I‚Äôm trying to move forward.  It also is constantly disconnecting from the Wi-Fi and takes a bunch of tries to reconnect.  When it is working it is nice, but I feel like I could have just used my phone and saved the money.

    Coming from a 1st edition paperwhite, I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed. The $25 trade-in credit + 20% off + 4 free months of my current Kindle Unlimited subscription saved me nearly $100. The new Paperwhite screen is crystal clear and very responsive. The addition of the new warm amber lights is awesome, especially if you like to read before bed to help you fall asleep. Battery life is nice too, currently at 72% after 2 weeks of everyday for a few hours.

    I usually read in Dark Mode, but the white letters were not bright enough for comfortable reading.  The Black and White screen had a lot of grey which made a lot of the titles on the books VERY difficult to read.

    This definitely lives up to the advertised improvements compared to the previous Paperwhite. It responds much faster to input, the bigger screen is great and looks great; it now can display as much text on a page as a typical paperback. Battery life seems better too.

    Frozen screen, customer service
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased this paper white 2021 early December. I like it at first, because I can read at bed without disturb my wife. But after three weeks the screen got frozen. I called customer service then they put me on the rotation pick up call. I had to explain my issue multiple times, and tried multiple ways to solve the frozen issue. I followed the instructions to reset/hard reset many times, but the issue remained. Finally, customer service agreed to replace it. After two weeks, I am still waiting the replacement paperwhite. I don't know when I can it and customer service won't give me a n answer. It is very disappointed.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my 3rd or 4th Kindle Paperwhite.  I loved the first two, but sadly I think this one is a big step backwards.  True, it has a bigger screen in a ""container"" of the same size, BUT the way that is achieved leaves so little border that I frequently find myself inadvertently changing pages backward and forwards OR even turning it off.  I've tried lots of adjustments over the 3+ months that I've had it, but none work.  Amazon has simply crowded too much into a small space.  Also, I can no longer have the time of day show at the top of the screen all the timeVery disappointed.

    I LOVE kindles, and this one is no exception. The warm light is in the pictures as yellow, but it also goes the other way to an ice blue! And the touch response is miles better than the older kindle, a tap is almost instantly registered.If you are on the fence- just try it! You have my permission and recommendation!

    Screen is very slow response
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I asked for a new Paperwhite for Christmas because I noticed a slowdown in screen response. I also wanted waterproof. My old one still functions very well otherwise, and I may go back to it, because the brand new, updated Paperwhite is so... much... slower. It takes a long time to wake up. It takes a long time to enter my passcode. It takes AGES to write a brief note. It's insane. And the battery life is not really better, either. I'm incredibly disappointed with this item, since my other one is about 6 years old. I expected vast improvement in the technology. But other than supposedly being waterproof, it's actually much worse.

    You breathe, it scratches
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve had this for four days, used for probably two hours total, and it has these scratches that really bother me and distract me from reading. Tried to contact support for an exchange and they would not do that. It‚Äôs decent to read on, but it obviously is not going to hold up even under gentle use. I bought on sale so was hoping I could exchange, but now I will just be retuning and not purchasing a new one. Edit: I was not happy with the return options and am still very sad Amazon would not allow me a new kindle at the same price I had paid. However I decided that rather than be without a reading device, or pay significantly more than I did, I would keep this one. I put a matte screen cover on it which does diminish the screen resolution, but I can‚Äôt see the scratches. It will do well enough. Still, overall would not recommend for the cost.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have a beloved fifth generation  Kindle that has seen more than it's share of books. Receiving notice it would no longer be updated with new software and security, I purchased this one which arrived the day it was released. Big mistake. I had to update the software as soon as I received it.I downloaded a few books in my library for a plane trip - they would not open on the airplane & I kept getting a message I needed to sign into Wi-Fi. Why? The books were already downloaded.When I got to my destination I was able to open a book. For some annoying reason the word ""highlights"" appeared over certain sentences. Where they came from & how to remove them was a complete mystery until I read a review here from Sarah. After following her instructions I was able to get rid of highlights that others reading the same book had placed. Why would I want to see others highlights, Amazon?  Even worse, it appears this procedure will have to be done for each book. Why should I have to edit highlights out of my books?Further, I sorted the books in my 5th Gen nto categories, making them easy to locate when I wanted to read a certain genre. Where did they go? Why didn't they transfer somewhere I could find them?So many reviewers are mentioning warmth, display, brightness, etc., as problems. All I want is to be able to find the books I already had in my library. And I want them in the way I sorted them, not the way Amazon is now presenting them, which is by series.I don't like this Kindle and am feeling the same way about Amazon.

    i purchased this device a couple of months and I must say the battery life and reading quality are second to none. However the internet access is pathetic.

    A step backwards for E-ink technology, low contrast
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I really like the size of this new device, it‚Äôs really light and the back light is very bright.  But this is where the pros stop for me. I currently use a 2014 paper white and wanted to get this new 2021 upgraded unit. However, I find this new unit has a very soft almost fuzzy screen.  The contrast, between the black letters and book covers and the bright white background is low, soft and bland. The letters should POP! But they don‚Äôt!E-ink technology is getting worse, the letters on my older model are so sharp, crisp and clear and look like they‚Äôre almost floating on the background. On this new model they more or less just blend in with the fuzzy background. I‚Äôve read that is because they made the screen flush on this model and that involves adding more layers of plastic which dull the contrast.It‚Äôs a real shame that people new to E-readers think that this is a such great device. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it has some great attributes, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about the display quality and when you have something to compare it with, this new model doesn‚Äôt deliver.New Paperwhite on left and old 2014 on right, same font and lighting settings, unfortunately the picture doesn‚Äôt really come through well.I ended up with a Kobo Libra 2, the screen contrast is brilliant and I like the software better than kindle

    I will update my review once my fianc√© opens it up and uses it. I bought this as one of his Christmas/Birthday gifts because he has been talking about getting one for a while now. I'm appalled at how this gift was packaged. I don't have a lot of money and this wasn't cheap, so I expected it to be protected....Whoever packaged this Kindle put it in a box with nothing else!!! There was zero protection. I could have a Kindle that doesn't start or work properly because it was being banged around in a box. I could also be overreacting, but this is a gift and I paid good money for it to be functional.Keeping my fingers crossed for no issues.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My Kindle Fire will not hold a charge anymore, so I started looking for a replacement. I read many reviews of how much people loved their paper white so I decided to give it a try. I researched it before buying it and thought I would like it since it is glare free, even though it had less features than my Fire. I was wrong. I miss the scroll page option and text to speech. I also need big letters to see and since the screen is so small, it seems like I have to click to turn the page constantly. I kept it too long past the return window thinking it would just take time to get used to it. I wish I had saved the money, and just bought another fire. It just isn‚Äôt the right book for me.

Which I wasn‚Äôt doing before cause I don‚Äôt like reading on my phone or iPad screen.However, it just stopped working. I got it in February and it is now may. It just acts like it‚Äôll load but it never comes off the loading screen. I let it die thinking if I did that and then plugged it in and left it alone it would work again. Essentially unplug it and then plug it back in again. Nope. Still just stuck on the loading screen. Waste of more than $100. I‚Äôm so upset üò≠üò≠üò≠

    When it works, I love this Kindle. The lightweight device is nice in hand. The screen brightness can be adjusted to a comfortable level. Overall, I liked it... when it was workingThe Kindle would freeze and stop working entirely. This first happened four days after I got the new release. Amazon Support was great and sent a new one. After 30 days, the second one had the same issue. The screen would stop on the loading screen and nothing more would happen. I went through all the steps Amazon Support recommends, and still nothing. The Kindle is essentially dead when stuck on the loading screen.The ordeal to get a replacement for the a second one was a month-long nightmare. I spoke with Support multiple times regarding my replacement. I had already sent in the original, malfunctioning drvice after being told I wouldn't get a replacement until I sent it in.Every representative I talked to said the new one would ship, that it was in the advanced stages of shipping and couldn't be cancelled. Finally, after speaking with 10 different reps, over the course of two weeks, I got a refund. I don't know if I'll get a new Kindle Paperwhite or just let it go.

So disappointed in this kindle especially for the price.  UPDATE: An Amazon Representative contacted me about the issues I was having with my kindle paperwhite e reader. Amazon replaced my glitchy kindle with a new one. All I needed to do was return the original kindle to them. The replacement kindle is working fine so.

    New paperwhite is junk
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had numerous kindles and I've loved them.  My earlier generation paperwhites worked wonderfully and still do. I actually only bought  a new one for the bigger screen and because I had chipped the older one and was worried it wasn't waterproof anymore.I've had 2 new 6.8"" paperwhites in last 6 months.  Both of them were glitchy, touch sensing would start to go, they would randomly forget my place in a book, the UX started getting all weird and the store wouldn't load.  In both cases, I attempted to reboot them to fix the software issues and both times, they never stopped rebooting.  They just rebooted themselves over and over until their batteries ultimately dies.To add insult to injury, in both cases, Amazon support also would not honor the return.  They said the return period closed.  I had to fight for hours with Amazon support to get a refund under the "" 1 year warranty"" and even then it wasn't a full refund.  They made me purchase  a new one (at a newer, higher price) and then made me call back to get the original refunded at the lower purchase price.  I was out an additional $35 and a month later still had  a second broken kindle.Again - I love the original paperwhite's but these new ones are junk and Amazon wont help you when they fail in  a month.  I wish I was wrong, because I just want a working paperwhite.

    Awful! Amazon has sent me 3 and they all malfunction
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve gotten 3, so far, from Amazon and they all malfunction and stop working in under two weeks.  They first try to send you a refurbished one but that ones already directive. We had to call and complain non stop for a refund just so we could purchase a new one without previously known issues‚Ä¶ otherwise they were just going to send me another refurbished one which the rep said would probably have problems. They supposedly noted our account several times about ‚Äúthe plan‚Äù. ( the plan being they would credit us a gift card to buy a new one after receiving the ones we sent them ) After sending back the first two we had to literally fight for WEEKS to get a gift card refund so we could get the new one. They didn‚Äôt automatically credit me.  We were still paying for the service but with no tablet. They apparently couldn‚Äôt tell it was sent back until we complained to several reps. It was never going to be credited. This was a nightmare. We got the 3rd tablet Monday and it‚Äôs Thursday today. It‚Äôs already malfunctioning. I would not recommend this product or recommend depending on Amazon to follow through with what they agreed to do.  We had to fight so hard just get get our money back in the form of a gift card just to get another defective product.

    I have been a Kindle user and advocate since the first Kindle Reader.  As each of my Kindles ""died"" I purchased the next Kindle edition. My son gave me the current version circa 2021. The screen quality excellent. However, the user interface is complicated. Indeed, I have found impossible when I purchase a new book and then attempt to sycn/download onto my Kindle. When downloading a book, the synching option is buried in some interface which is completely user unfriendly. Kindle was a simple product and device. The geeks have created a completely user-unfriendly product. Amazon, I ask that you return to the elegance of previous products. This one is impossible. I will seek alternatives including hardcopy purchases not through Amazon.

Will try for a couple weeks but not impressed so far.Update 03/03/22_Discovered a bad screen pixel. Returning and will continue to use my current Kindle.

    The screen is outstanding and the size is a nice compared to larger tablets (i.e., 8"" or bigger). It is easy to hold and read, yet still small enough to carry in a pocket. The software has evolved to be flexible and easy to use. This is great for. reading outside in daylight, yet still illuminated for darker conditions.

    THIS IS A 2-FOLD REVIEW!! The Paperwhite I bought, $139.00, then insurance was NOT GOOD. Just like the customer service I got on it.  Paperwhite was nice and light, when it worked it worked but not great, but ok!  I made 4 different phone calls to tell them my paperwhite I ordered on Nov. 28th and got a couple days later had quit working!! It worked 3 quarters of the way for 3 months! The Insurance phone number got me nothing, but line drop after about 5 min of talking to them. The Amazon Customer service sucks. 1st call, gentleman was so nice, no problem, would send me a new one in two days and instructions to return one not working. Then an email, a delay in shipping and I would be notified of new shipping date! NOTHING, waited, called 2nd time, got a gentleman that was nasty!! Could or would not give me a new shipping date said I would get an e-mail with that on it!! Never came, only another one e-mail telling me I would get another e-mail!!!!  Third call to Insurance, got a nice lady was trying to help me after 15 min we got cut off, not call back! Called a 4th time, Amazon, talked to gentleman that was very nice, I was not, I ask to speak to supervisor, never got to. This guy had me place a new order, (CHARGED TO MY ACCOUNT) told me they would refund it when I sent back the one not working!!!! Will see! Will back and by a Kindle or another reader somewhere else, NOT AMAZON!!  THIS PLACE HAS GOTTEN TO BIG FOR IT'S SELF.

    The hardware works well. Easy to read. Pages flip reasonably quickly.  The user interface is painful.  The designers should not be shot but a little mild torture would not be out of line.  Where is the download for my 1000 books on the Amazon cloud? Why can't I see the lists of books so I can quickly find the one I want? Where is the LOCAL search?  I don't want JUST a seach of all books on Amazon.  I probably won't return the kindle but its painful enough to use that it will be relegated to the bathroom.

    So far, not impressed. My 2014 Kindle still works mostly fine, but I wanted to upgrade due to a few minor hiccups and wanting more features. I didn't have the cover option, updated the software on my fresh-from-the-box Paperwhite 11th Gen, and now I'm getting ads; when I try to turn them off in Amazon content & devices, it throws an error. I have no option to view the book cover, and I can't NOT see reading lists and recommendations on the home screen.I paid for zero ads, and one update later, and I'm seeing ads--and, of course, Amazon's help section is giving me the runaround so I can't even troubleshoot.

    I purchased this assuming it would work with Hoopla from the library like other Kindles do.  Unfortunately, it does not support and Android Apps so it will not work with Hoopla or most other Apps.  I went ahead and did the free trial for Kindle Unlimited which it says also even includes audiobooks.  Literally searched my 10 favorite authors and none of them are included nor any books I was intending to read so it's not really unlimited anything.  Even the books that are there and included, the audio is extra, so this all really just feels like a big money grab from Amazon forcing us all to read only their content.  Also, the touch screen is also extremely slow to respond so you'll think it's frozen but really it's just lagging.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have been an owner of Kindles since 2011 with hundreds of hours of reading. Kindle was a pleasure to own because I could adjust the size of the font and the boldness of the print. I have severe eye problems and Kindle allowed me to continue reading. In 2021 I received a notice from Amazon that Kindle was being replaced with an upgrade. On October 23, 2021 I ordered two new Kindles. From the beginning the page was very sensitive and would flip back and forth. So when opening I never knew what page it would be on. Usually it was just a few pages either back or forward. Frustrating, but I learned to live with it. Then it progressed to only opening at the beginning of the last time I opened the Kindle. Example: yesterday I started reading at 17% and read to 23%. When I opened the Kindle today it opened back at 17%. It got worse. I have been reading a series. I am now on book 2. When opening Kindle it opened in book 1 at page 8. Also the font was changed. I tried ""settings"" but could not access it. I tried different things, then finally had to re-boot Kindle. I have wasted so much time trying to find where I left off it has taken so  much joy out of reading. I would not recommend your ""new and Improved"" Kindle to anyone. What a rip-off. Signed a very frustrated owner of Kindle.

But also to read books for as long as I can. I am disabled (can't walk, on oxygen all the time, etc) and almost don't get out of my house due to my bad health.

    I loved being able to read in the sun, and also not have to worry about it getting wet. I hate the buggy browser. Response time is also unbearably slow. In the past I‚Äôve read ebooks on the Kindle app on my iPad. The iPad interface is much better. I was surprised to see that the actual Kindle was much less functional and extremely user-unfriendly. For example, when reading a book on my iPad, I can easily scroll through Notes and Highlights, but the Paperwhite only scrolls one note at a time, is unbearably slow, and the scroll bar doesn‚Äôt work at all. I will keep this Kindle for checking out library books to read on the boat, but I won‚Äôt be using it for any academic reading.

    Customer support was helpful and kind. Helpful in terms of just using the warranty. I was basically told that it shouldn't have battery issues this early. After googling the issue, I found that this is a pretty common occurrence. Don't let your battery die and don't go long periods of time not using the kindle!Especially once the warranty ends, because they will just give you a 15% off coupon for a new kindle. This seems like a known issue with Amazon! Definitely worried for after the warranty, but I honestly had the best time reading for the 4 days it was working fine.No amount of charging or button pressing is saving this kindle.People even suggested throwing it in a freezer. I did it out of desperation and a last resort, but still nothing.Apparently this flickering (like when you turn a page), is normal for the type of screen that's used. It means the screen is changing. So my screen is TRYING to change from the tree screen I guess, but reverts back to it no matter what I do.

    I was giving a Kindle for Christmas last year. I absolutely loved it. Battery, while on the annoying ad screensaver lasts days, I'd even say maybe 2 weeks. Aside from the touchscreen being wonky, it was good. Until my wifi is out due to an outage and I want to read until everything is working again. You can't read downloaded books without wifi? Why can't it fully download the first time and be readable WITHOUT wifi? The older versions of Kindle let you fully download books and read with or without wifi, so why can't the assumably better next gen do the same? Am I missing a setting or something? It's ridiculous and disappointing because if I ever travel, I can't bring this with on a plane.

    Ok, I've had a kindle since the keyboard one (when they first came out), then I got a paperwhite, and now this one.  I am a HUGE kindle fan and have read hundreds of books on them, maybe even over a thousand.  I am so disappointed in this one.  The paperwhite was great, but my puppy hit the screen with one of her nails and caused a bright spot... This kindle is a good size, the battery life is great and the screen/backlights are nice but,  and this is a BIG but... it is really slow and is constantly locking up.  The screen will not respond, can't turn pages or even hit the shut off button when re booting, so have to hold the physical button on the bottom forever.  I've had this for about 3 months and read probably 40 books or so.  I have to re boot just about every day (a VERY slow process).  When waking up it takes forever before you can swipe to unlock.  Sometimes if I shift my fingers on the bezel edges (not the screen itself) the pages just start flipping, if I try to go back (touch left side of screen) it flips forward.  I really dislike this newest kindle, it's a piece of junk and reading is now a chore (and I very much LOVE to read!!!!!)

    I have had kindle paper whites for years. I recently upgraded from the last model to this 2021 model and I regret it. The screen locks up frequently. This is my 2nd one as they replaced the first one after 2 days because it was locking up but the new one is even worse.  It locks up while on wifi and while in airplane mode so it is not a Wifi issue. I‚Äôve done hard restarts and also reset it. Nothing helps. When it finally does correct itself, the touchscreen will be very slow/delayed until I let is sleep for hours. It‚Äôs new so I have 5.5GB free so it should not be related to storage.  I also have the most current update. Customer service just has me reset it which had not solved the problem.

    Newspaper download requires reset every single day
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my 10th Kindle. I love Kindle Paperwhite. BUT, and this is a huge BUT, Amazon‚Äôs latest software upgrades have completely destroyed the newspaper subscription download function. So, if you love reading The New York Times and Washington Post daily on your Kindle Paperwhite, you will be driven mad. Hours of time wasted with tech support trying in vain to fix this, only to be informed, finally, that there is no fix and the automatic daily download of my newspapers is a problem Amazon is working on. So, I have to completely reset my Kindle every single day if I want to read today‚Äôs newspaper. This involves inputting my Internet password, Amazon password, choosing my language and country, waiting for the device to reset, declining Kindle Unlimited, and many more steps. Supremely irritating if you want to read the newspaper with your morning coffee. And this problem has been going on for months. This is an example of how Amazon‚Äôs software ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù have ruined a great feature of the Kindle Paperwhite. Every morning as I spend five minutes resetting in a ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù type of rage, I hope some Amazon software engineer has been fired.

    First Kindle, malfunctioned in 2 weeks and had to get a replacement.
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I received this Kindle Paperwhite for my birthday on December 26th, 2021. This was my first Kindle. 10 days later, the screen froze out of nowhere on the Kindle logo and it would not unlock or turn off. I tried to follow all the steps on the customer service help page to restart the Kindle, but the screen would not even turn off.Customer service offered to replace my Kindle right away (I'm currently waiting on the replacement). However, I had to make the trip to UPS and pay for packaging myself. They will not send the new one until they receive the old one. My replacement Kindle has not updated any shipping or delivery information other than ""order received""I've read customer reviews similar to my situation that have expressed that their replacement Kindle did the exact same thing that their originals did OR they were given a refurbished Kindle when it should've been brand new. I'm hoping to loop back to this with some positives once my replacement comes.

    Got it yesterday, updated it.  Now there are ads on the homescreen, and it's frozen at least twice.  Had to hold the button down to crash it.  It's also down to 44% battery life after about 4 hours of reading.  Not very impressive.FYI I bought the version without ads.UPDATE 2021.11.14 - The power drains have stopped.  It's still frozen several more times, that you can't go to the next page.  Have to reboot it to get it to work.

    Had I known that I was getting into a product that seems like a 4th or 5th grader programmed at their whim with no Planning involved I would NOT have bought this Kindle. I'm used to computers in general and between my Mac and Win machines I would choose my Mac 1,000 times out of 1,000 over the Win, however, I live in a ""Windows"" world atmosphere and use it more. This Kindle is positively wonk-oh as far as trying to even find your files and then when you do, nothing that you've pulled down from Am to your computer seems to be ""findable"" quickly. I had to hunt all over for those Downloads because they didn't go to my Downloads FOLDER! Amazon KINDLE needs to hire about 10 APPLE Programmers to make the Kindle even somewhat 'human friendly"". NOT a happy customer especially with all of the marketing hype about how easy it is to sit and read your books. I have one on-screen that continually pops up which is frustrating to the MAX. There is no way to END the damned thing!

    While the screen is larger, the margins are smaller, this constantly triggers settings screens or page backward, etc., all commands on the margins of the screen.Also, the lack of of direct connectivity to seamlessly download new books or synchronize the device means you have to be looking for wifi when you travel.It was more expensive than my previous kindle & it was a downgrade. I am seriously considering not buying a kindle next, just sticking with the kindle app next time.

    I am very disappointed in the new Kindle. The home screen was very cluttered with way more than the books that I loaded - all sorts of ""recommendations, etc"".I was also disappointed at how difficult it is to download a book by USB. In addition it requires wi-fi to open a book for the first time, which makes it quite to do so when I am not home.To try to reduce the unwanted icons, I bought the ""no ads"". This didn't get rid of all the flotsam and jetsam, and on top of that the fee is not refundable. Can we say ""RIP OFF??""It seems that the Kindle creators are trying to make this do everything.  All I want is a simple e-reader that I can load up with books to read any where and any time. This doesn't come close to what I am looking for, so I am returning it!

    This is my 6th or so kindle, so I know these devices well. The hardware is nice.I'm writing to talk about the Kindle software, which is constantly pushing me to buy more stuff and I'm sick of it. It's trying to get you to sign up for Kindle Unlimited, GoodReads, and Audible.You no longer have the option of defaulting to the Library screen, and it always goes to the Home screen, which is just trying to recommend you more books.On the library screen, the list view is comically huge to the point where you can only see 5 books/files per page. They don't want you to browse your own books/files. You can't change the size, it's so irritating.If you choose the ad supported option, you now have to swipe every time you wake the device to get rid of the ads. The ads use to be on the sleep screen only, now they are in your face when you wake the device.It makes me want to leave the ecosystem.

Downloading new books is frequently a nightmare; usually get a message that an error occurred. This is my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite and absolutely the worst ever. Oh, and I've only had it for 2 months.

    I bought the new version of the Paperwhite in November.  I have owned three different kindle versions (my husband and kids also have Fires) and I have used one for many years every single day.  I was excited about finally seeing that there was an updated version.  There are some things that I liked about the updated device, like the quicker turning pages, but I didn't notice much of a difference between the older size and the newer, larger size.  I was not a fan of the new library set up, but overall, it was a fine device.  However, after less than 6 months, it went into a cycle where you couldn't turn it on-it would boot up like it was turning on, but then would turn immediately back off.  It does this every 40 seconds...and has for the past few days.  It charges, but is stuck in an initialization cycle.  I spent 20 minutes on a chat with Amazon help today and they will refund my money (after I send it back), but now I don't know whether to order another one or not.  There seems to be a lot of issues with this newer version and I don't love the idea of buying it again only to have another one break.

Library is hard to access from a book.  charging cord plug-in is at the bottom instead of the top which makes it difficult to have it sit on a stand for hands-free reading.  Changing whether you read landscape or portrait is also tricky.  Why can't it just change when you. change the orientation of the screen?  Not worth the money spent.

    I decided to buy this for Christmas as an upgrade over a Kindle Fire that is probably 7+ years old. I don‚Äôt remember when it was purchased. I received the Paperwhite and immediately started learning how it worked. I have lots of cons which is why I returned the Paperwhite and went back to my Kindle Fire.Display: Kindle Fire has a color display, Paperwhite does not. I thought I‚Äôd be okay with this and I wasn‚Äôt. I like seeing book covers and text in color. Although the Paperwhite does have a lot more options for font size and style, screen brightness.Interface: Kindle Fire has all of your buttons for home, back, text, notes at the bottom of the screen. I like this setup. Paperwhite you had to tap the screen and have all of the buttons pop up. Some were at the top, some at the bottom. A lot of times when I would tap the screen the page would turn. It was very frustrating and probably the biggest dislike I had with the Paperwhite. Home Screen on the Paperwhite is also very confusing and not user friendly.Battery: Depending on how much I use my Kindle Fire the battery usually lasts about 12 reading hours. I used the Paperwhite for 24 hour reading hours and the battery hardly went down at all.Processing: I thought the Paperwhite would be fast in its processing speed but it wasn‚Äôt any faster than my Kindle Fire.Overall: overall I didn‚Äôt feel like the Paperwhite was an upgrade over my Kindle Fire.

    My new Kindle is so finicky I can barely use it--and therefore I hate it. Many many many times it won't even turn the page when I touch the screen, and then at other times it bumps me ahead 20 or more pages when I touch the screen, and then I can't go back and find my spot again--because who is ever going to remember location??? This happens over and over again. All the changes they made to the way you get around on the Kindle is extremely confusing, invisible, and hard to use, and is not straightforward like it used to be, and all of that, i.e., moving around, too, is extremely finicky, so that when you finally DO figure out how to get where you want to go, nothing works. They've taken away the ""list"" for your library, and put pictures there instead, which is extremely cumbersome and makes it hard to use/look/glance at your library, to figure out what you've read and what you want to read next, even if you can even manage to get to your library in the first place. I wish I could return it, but I'm past my return date.

    Dead Pixels, Amazon Refuses to Replace Device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    So I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite on sale. And unfortunately It's beginning to look like it's going to be fully returned. I've had it for less than 24 hours now and it already has at least 1 possibly 2 dead pixels, that are franky driving me nuts, call me neurotic or a perfectionist but when you shell out 100+ dollars for an electronic device you kinda expect it to be working for the company that manufactures and sells them to be able to offer a replacement of the device.I've gone around in a circle with customer support for a half hour now trying to get it sorted out but its becoming quite clear they don't care about honoring the standard retail arrangement of exchanging defective items. Kinda disappointing because I enjoyed reading it on it I guess. But I'm not going to pay 100+ dollars and then play 130+ dollars because customer support ""can't give a replacement""Update: After an hour online with customer service I finally got someone who knew what they were doing well enough to actually help me out.  I will update the review once a replacement has been received and hopefully has a fully functional screen.Update 2: It's been a couple of weeks now (almost a full month) still no eta on the replacement. Though they did appear to put the order through. Just waiting for an actual update to that ETA date still. Definitely would not recommend purchasing a Kindle at this point. I don't think that opinion will change. It's not worth the money for the hassle.

Touchscreen recognition is awful so pages don‚Äôt turn and highlighting precisely is a chore.When I‚Äôm dark mode, it turns white when you turn the page so defeats the purpose of dark mode.I‚Äôve owned an older paperwhite, an oasis, and the first kindle touch. This is definitely the most disappointing and there‚Äôs been no major changes. Year after year it‚Äôs basically the same device coming out but with more software bugs than the previous models. I‚Äôm definitely going to wait for a huge improvement before I buy another kindle.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The thin bezel is supposed to be an improvement but I cant hold the Kindle without a page turning or a menu popping up. All I want to do is hold it without having to glue on some kind of holder which defeats my purposed of having a thin, light weight kindle.I have a very old Kindle that I love but will no longer be able to download books as of the end of December. I never thought that I'd lose all my books and collections with an upgrade but books do not transfer and collections have to be recreated...after you download the book again! I'm sure it is the same with the 2018 model but at least I can comfortably read a book once I have downloaded it again and put it a collection again.I love the color adjustment and the battery life but I'm getting a 2018 version that at least has barely enough room to hold the device.

    This is the 4th Kindle I've purchased.  This product is just worse in every way.  My first Kindle was fast, quick, and snappy.  Easily the best purpose built device I had ever bought.Flash forward 5 years and today's Kindles are a joke.  The device is very slow and takes a long time to wake up or navigate the store.  Even turning the page results in a slight but noticeable delayThe brightness setting is pointless.  Regardless of where you set it, it will default to max brightness when you open it up for the first time, before reducing to your requested brightness a few seconds later.  This is a huge annoyance as I read at night.The reworked UI doesn't add any features while making you click 2-3 more times to adjust common settings like 'Brightness' or 'Font size'.I would not recommend an Amazon Kindle at this point.  They might have been good devices 5 years ago, but they've taken a step back since then and Amazon doesn't seem interested in righting the ship.UPDATE: After writing this review, Amazon called me in the middle of the week day to ask how they could fix it.  I asked the caller if he read my review.  He admitted that he had not.  Not only does Amazon make a bad product, they annoy you when you tell them about it.

    Update. Amazon has reached out for details about my issue. An exchange has been received. So far, it has made it through the update process. I am cautiously optimistic.Used for a couple of weeks. Paperwhite was a better reader than my previous fires. Loved the small size. No glare screen was beyond awesome.Touch screen was not sensitive enough to my liking but I was adjusting.Then it died. It's like in the middle of an update that it can't complete. I asked for an exchange and two weeks later, 3 chats and 2 calls to customer service, nothing. I'm finally asking for a refund. I thought that customer service would have been better for an actual Amazon product.Product good, turned bad and customer service made it worse. TBC.

    The AD version of this device is awful
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my third Kindle, and I've got to say it's the most disappointing. I had the 3rd and 7th general of Paperwhite, and only until their last days of operation did they begin to perform badly. This thing, on day one, let me swipe the unlock screen once before deciding that I needed to spend 45 minutes trying to get to the books I pre-paid to read on a device I paid good money for, to boot. Is the point of the 11th generation of this device to actually spend all of my time buying books but not reading them? Good grief. I would have purchased a non-Ad version for more, except that delivery would have been weeks instead of days, and my 7th Gen just up and died. Incredibly disappointing. Extremely aggravating. Now I wonder how much will it be to ""buy"" off the ads and get back to reading.

This can‚Äôt be true. If it is, can they have another update to fix it. As of this moment, you can only permanently delete a book which means if you bought it then you would have to buy it again.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    On my first device, the screen is greenish/darker around the bottom left edge, and I cant stop noticing it every time I read near that location.On my second device, it was a yellow blotch appearing slightly above the bottom left corner, with a diameter about 1/5 of screen width. Again, my eyes are attracted to it every time I read to that location.Both issues would appear under low ambient light, and disappear if ambient/day light is strong, so it seems that it's a front light issue. If I turn warm light all the way to max, I won't notice them, but the screen would be just too yellow.A Kobo libra 2 is on the way, if it has an even screen I'll keep it, otherwise I'll just return all three. I really like the paperwhite to work because it fits my budget better, but I am disappointed at this point.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had an older Kindle that I loved. In order to sell more products, Amazon changed the requirements on what version of Kindle could handle the new downloads and purchases. My old one had an easy feel in your hands, and the little side page-turner button was in the perfect location so you didn't have to keep letting go of the Kindle and moving your hand. This one has a very sensitive touchscreen. You have to let go of one side of the device and tap the screen every time you want to turn the page.You may tap it and while you lift your finger you may brush against it again and then you've advanced more pages than you intended and you've lost your place.  And if you're exploring the store, be careful that you don't buy something you don't want because the screen is so sensitive you very well might do that. Then it's a whole ordeal to un-buy it. New and improved it is not!

There is a sleep button on the bottom that constantly turns the device off while you‚Äôre reading.  Maybe the top would have been a better place to put it.

Again, went through all the trouble-shooting steps, with no change. This time the CS rep said ""they all do that.""  The next call, to a manager, resulted in the same comment. Brick wall. If this is true, then this is a terrible product if you like to read.  Interestingly, one of the video reviews shows a woman turning pages with absolutely no black flashing.

    So, the Kindle has been working fairly well since I've got it a couple of months ago but sadly, I had to wait over a month for the adapter to arrive just to charge it. The adapter arrives and I'm thinking, ""Cool, now I can charge it,  keep reading and I'm all set""...Wrong. The cord that they sent literally with the Kindle won't fit the charging slot on the device itself so basically, I waited over a month and spent close to $200 for a device that I can't charge because they gave me a cord with it that doesn't fit

    Terrible Quality Control
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Received 4 of these generation 11 Paperwhite Kindles. All of them had defective screens: Pixels which appear white on dark text or backgrounds, and pinholes that appear dark on white backgrounds. The pinhole type is even visible after turning the screen off (so there is no image and 0% brightness). With the screen off, it looks like a shiny dot. My previous gen Kindles did not have these problems.Surprising how well reviewed this device is considering the defects and poor quality control I encountered 4/4 times.Returning all 4- I don't even care about the Prime Day deal anymore, not worth the price for this junk.

Contacted customer service for a replacement and was told that no replacement was available and only offered a refund. But I purchased the item on sale and it is now full price.  They said there was nothing they could do.  Seems strange, very disappointed.  Will wait until it goes on sale again and try to buy a replacement then.  When it worked it was nice, though battery life was a bit worse than expected.

    Garbage compared to previous Kindle Paperwhites
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had a Paperwhite purchased years ago but it was getting older, and the battery wasn't lasting as long. I should have just had the battery replaced, but knew Kindle was coming out with a new generation. I donated my old Kindle, and received this version, 11 Generation, no ads, for Christmas in Dec 2021. Right away I disliked the protruding power button on the bottom that was super sensitive and would power off/on when propping the Kindle up to read or if packed in my handbag. Within a month it was glitchy. I knew getting a new one would be a nightmare--plus I am always in the middle of a good book!--so I just would reboot it. So many times I lost my place. Today, it went into a continual loop of re-booting and shutting off. I am beyond disappointed. They should stop selling this faulty product.

    I'm not impressed with this Kindle version.  Have a terrible time locating books I've downloaded from the Kindle Unlimited store.  It turns out that if you download more than one book in a series, the Kindle creates a collection.  If I want a collection, I'll create it myself.  My old Kindle put all the new downloads together so they were easy to locate.  The only reason I bought a new kindle is because my ancient Kindle died.  I do like that fact that this Kindle is easier to read.

    My complaints lie with the navigation which is almost entirely random. Getting back to the Home page was damn near impossible. There is a Home button on the bottom of the page (instead of the top?) which simply does not work. In fact nothing at the bottom works.The entire navigation metaphor needs an overhaul by a team that actually understands the user experience..Since I am visually impaired, I purchased an audio bock as my first text. It lists 19 unnamed chapters. No matter which chapter I click on, it takes me to somewhere else. WFT? There is absolutely no correlation between the chapters listed in Kindle and the chapters in the book.I called their customer service and told them to send me a replacement. I hope I just got a bad unit. If not, I am stuck.

    I love to read. I had an original Paperwhite I bought almost 10 years ago that I lost in a move. I bought this one and had it for two months. I just asked to return it last night. Several times over the two months the thing would randomly freeze, while I was in the middle of reading, and begin updating itself, the process itself took at least 10 minutes and ended me on a nice white screen and an inability to navigate anywhere. I had to restart the thing manually.When I went online to remedy the process, there are two solutions: Jailbreak your paperwhite, or use airplane mode EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO READ.You aren't even allowed to turn off mandatory updates for a later date. Why did the engineers allow it to update without being connected to a charger? Or WHILE ACTIVELY IN USE?Anyway, after the xth time it's shut down and restart itself, I'm done. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

It wouldn‚Äôt restart and had to be returned within a month. Exchanged for a new one. New one locked up like the first in just a few weeks. This device is not stable yet and should not have been released to the public.Overall, the UI is clunky and confusing to use. Setting are all over the place. You just poke around until you find want you need. It‚Äôs easy to turn pages unintentionally because the narrow borders make it easy to get your finger on the screen. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to use without a case.Having said all that, the screen is so good that I would be willing to live with it if the device was reliable. Sending this second one back. Going to get an small iPad from a pawn shop to replace it. Pity...

    It's just too frustrating to figure out how to use it. If you accidentally touch something, the book might go to the last page, or the first page, or who knows where. Then it takes multiple attempts to get back to where I was. Do I tap? Do I swipe? Sometimes I'd accidentally touch the screen before I swiped and it does what it wants. Kindle Unlimited is limited. For some reason, I could only download maybe 10 books. I don't want to buy them. Most of the books I was interested in could only be purchased. If an author had a set of 5 books, I had to download one at a time, making me go back to the store to find the next one. It would be nice if the Home and Library buttons were always displayed.

However, while its screen is more responsive and broader, it used to freeze every time I tried to browse in the Kindle store or download new books. That was super annoying because I only had it for a few weeks and my old 7th generation Kindle works better than this one. Battery life is also very short, it doesn't last for weeks or a month as promised. In fact, it has a shorter lifespan than my old Kindle's battery had when it was new. And what's worst, this new Kindle became unresponsive after only three weeks of use, it got stuck during the restart and it's not working anymore. So, I don't recommend this item, if you don't want to lose your money for defective and slow device. I can't even get replacement item as I don't live in U.S.

    1. The Kindle I had before was better visually and did not have the issues of the new models.  First, the new ""gray-shading"" phase makes the book covers unreadable and less sharp.  Second, it drops the internet connection when I am literally 5 feet from it and surrounded with a laptop and iphone--all connected.  Third, the keyboard just disappeared.  I've called and gone through instructions to reset and  it will come back but it never has.  FOURTH: So now, I cannot connect to the internet because I cannot type in the password because I do not have a keyboard! Fifth. Maybe an Apple iPad is the way to go than the endless frustrations of needing to endlessly update or endlessly figure out why the new Kindle doesn't work.

I shook and shook it and water just keeps coming out through the USB port and power button.  Exchanged and the 2nd one did it too.  In fact if it‚Äôs underwater and you squeeze it slightly it sucks a lot of water into the device.  Even though it worked, that water will either cause corrosion or mold/mildew over time.

This is the first time I have been totally dissatisfied by Amazon ""customer service"".  Very disappointing.

    Years ago a friend gave me a Nook. I love my Nook. I can do email, use the Internet, read, and do all other kinds of stuff - in color! But my old nook is on its last legs. So, I decided in November to take advantage of the after Thanks Giving sales to get a Kindle. And after my Nook, it was quite a shock. I had a hard time getting used to it and went to eBay and bought another used Nook. Again, I love a Nook, but the battery life in this used Nook HD is truly terrible. Gradually I got used to the Kindle and used it more and more. One and a half months after purchase the Kindle quit with an error code. I returned the Kindle a week ago and I still have no date to when they will ship me a new one. Thank heavens for my Nook. So, as of now I am not a fan of the Kindle.

    A buggy device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My brand new Kindle Paperwhite is dead after three months and is on its way back to Amazon.  It shows a Code 2 Error and would not reboot.  Regardless of software or hardware issues, such a fatal flaw cannot be acceptable.Prior to this, I had encountered errors when I tried to delete book samples.  It just said it cannot be done and advised me to try later.  It also froze from time to time.There are other usability issues too.  The top bezel is too narrow so when I tried to hold it with my left hand‚Äôs index finger on it, it would open the drop down menu.  It is also too wide so I can not fit it to my hand comfortably.I don‚Äôt know how a buggy product like this could pass quality control.  I assume it will soon be replaced.

    Eight days after receiving my Paperwhite I had to return it.  A couple of days after receiving the Paperwhite my ""Uh-Oh"" sense was triggered when I the Paperwhite would not go to the next page unless I first went back to the prior page read.  Then the Paperwhite locked up for good on to the last page of a book I had previously read on my old Kindle.  Why there and not on some current page?Because my old Kindle is becoming obsolete, I'll need to buy another Paperwhite.  I can only hope my experience so far is not typical.

I also wanted to use bluetooth for my Airpods so I can listen to Audible books, but that does not work - the Paperwhite can connect to my Airpods but I hear no audio.

    I've owned a half a dozen or more different kindles and was very pleased with the purchase of this one until the newest ""update"" to 5.14.2. Removing the ability to view my books without your shitty thumbnails, breaking my ability to view collections, making it impossible to view more than 5 collections on a page since those also apparently need useless thumbnails (That are blank folder icons in this case since it's a collection so they're even more pointless). I've literally dug through my closet to find an old Kindle Oasis that I'll forcibly keep from updating should it try to do so. If I had the option I'd refund my purchase because as is, it's trash. Unless this is fixed you've lost a customer.

No.  The old version fit in a large coat pocket or a small purse - this version will be too big for both. One of the great things about the kindle is portability. Please make an updated version in the old size.  I had my first kindle for five years. I have had to buy a new one every 1.5-2 years for the past three.  Amazon only seems to be good at taking things that were fine and changing them for the worse.  I will probably end up with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù old version because mine does not hold charge, so i need one to charge at home and one to take take out with me.  New one is too big to carry around.

    Everyone recommends the Paperwhite. I do not. Its easy to read (when it actually opens a book) its a little slow to respond with a weird flickering between pages.

I wanted to restart the Kindle and the only button that worked was the cancel button so I cant even turn it off / restart it. This product is already a paperweight right out of the box.

Nope, even while not even touching the screen, the PAGES RANDOMLY TURN BACK & FORTH.  Also, after reading for maybe an hour, the PAGE FREEZES & I HAVE TO RESTART , which then loses my last page read.  Never had any problems with my original kindle & if this had happened, I would never recommend it.  Hoping to return this one & get a replacement.  We shall see.....

    On any other device when I select Dark Mode, to read in bed at night, I get a true white text on a black screen.Not so on this 2021 11th gen Paperwhite device. While the white is white, the black is also white. If you turn down the back light so it more dark, then the text is too dark also.If you turn up the back light so you can read the white text now the background lights up. In other words, the backlight is visible and lights up the screen. This is NOT what you want when reading in the dark.Save your money, get the plain Kindle, if you just want to read in the daylight.  I'll go back to my Kindle 3 keyboard model.BTW, this Kindle has a USB C connector. It's the only device I have that has it. So ANOTHER cable to carry. Another reason to return it.

    I used this product for pleasure reading.  The touch screen was very unreliable.  I would get stuck on a place in the book and couldn't get the screen to move.  I can no longer find the books in the library.  Sometimes the screen was very sensitive to the touch and would whisk me away far away.  I would like to return this Kindle and the new charger that I was forced to buy in order to use it. The older models were far superior to the current ones.

    When I first received this Kindle, I was in love. I had an older generation and used it daily. So I was excited for an upgrade. But a little less than a year, it broke. The screen just kept trying to load. Got sent a replacement and the screen stops working again. I am very cautious with my kindle. To have screen issues a 2nd time from a 2nd device is ridiculous. I never had any issues with my older one and I had that for over 3 years. So disappointing

    I have been a user of Kindles for several years now. I gave my spouse my previous Paperwhite and ordered a new one for myself in November. Yes, I'm a selfish bugger. Anyway, there were problems from the start. Initially the Kindle would not always save to the point read in books, even books from my Kindle Unlimited account.  I wasn't too worried as I believed the next update would probably solve the issue.  Yesterday it froze and all the Amazon troubleshooting tips failed to get it beyond the  boy-under-tree screen.  Called support and my only option was a refund.  I was hoping for an exchange as a matter of convenience.  Now I am wondering whether I should buy the current generation, or should just get the previous one which has never given me problems?

    It's been years since I owned a Paperwhite, so I was expecting great things from this new version.Why is the button on the bottom of the device? This is my biggest complaint. I've had the device for maybe 10 minutes and it's accidentally gone on twice now. Who designed that and thought it would be a good idea? I don't want one of those hard cases, so I can foresee this thing being on without me knowing.My other issue is the charger. It's my own fault for not realizing I'd have to buy a twenty dollar wall charger because I use a Chromebook, with no USB port. Ugh. So I'm returning it. No sense in being annoyed for this price.

    Doesn‚Äôt keep place in books
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I would advise sticking with your old kindle. This new one wasn‚Äôt keeping my place in my book. Every time I went to read again it would be in the wrong place way further back in my book. So I tried to restart it to see if that would help and it completely froze and will not come back on. I‚Äôve used kindles for 10 years and never had trouble like this with older models. So I‚Äôm returning this and going back to old reliable.

    I‚Äôve had 5 previous Kindles. All worked out of the box. Have loved them till they simply stopped. Solution ‚Ä¶ buy another. Support leaves a bit to be desired. Easier to just replace. The new one will not connect. Tried and true connection with multiple devices working on a daily basis. Patiently, went through the troubleshooting. Nothing. It‚Äôs headed to the trash.

    It fails at the basic function of the device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I spent about 40 minutes on chat with Amazon before the representative ""got disconnected"" then another 20 minutes or so on the phone with a representative -- None of them seem to know how to remove the requirement to swipe up to view my book. My 2015 Kindle just shows my book when I open the cover. Apparently that isn't an option anymore. So, this device will be going back. I'm not spending $200 to be forced to look at Ads.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This was my first paperwhite. Needless to say, I was pretty darn excited. Imagine my let down with every lag, screen freeze and long loading times. Pictures are also fuzzy when scrolling. If you want to use your Overdrive/Libby from your local library, forget about it! No app usage and the web browser is pretty much non usable with its constant loading and freezing. Who has time to get on the computer to send to the books you want from Overdrive to your Kindle. I sent this garbage back.

    I loved this until it stopped working less than 2 weeks after I got it. I am extremely disappointed. Amazon customer service says there is nothing they can do but replace it and it will take over a week and a half to ship the new one. Other reviews I have found online state a similar problem. You would think a device that has been in the making with so many generations and costs over $130 would be better quality.

    Update***  After speaking with Amazon about their Kindle Software Updates I am not satisfied with my Kindle Paperwhite.  They took my concerns and problems and said they would give it to the software developers and make it easier and more user friendly.  I am glad that they wanted to contact me about my concerns especially since my mother reads with the Paperwhite also.I love love love my Kindle Paperwhite but I hate this latest update!!!! I understand that it is to fix the latest bugs and issues but I do not like the new format for  Home and Library screen. I like being able to catalog my books by authors in collections but instead of searching for the collection I have to go through a bunch of crap and it will not let me save the books like before.My 81 year old mother who loves her Paperwhite is also fed up with the changes.  I would love to be able to download the bugs and fixes but not change the how my Home and Library screens look.I am seriously considering going with another Ereader from B&N or Apple Books because this is not a good direction for Amazon to be going especially a long standing Prime Member who has had an Ereader since 2011

I'll never understand how they get a screen to look like the page of a book, but I guess I don't need to understand it. All I know is that the Paperwhite makes e-books incredibly easy to read in any light setting, and I don't know why I've been reading paper books the last few years when I could have been reading them on a Paperwhite.

    Great Device, But Needs a Pocket Sized Model
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've been using my Kindle Paperwhite for about a year now. It's a fantastic device. The only caveat I have with the device itself is the size. If I stuck this device in my jeans, I'm barely fitting anything else and my pocket looks like a giant square. I would love it if Amazon released a kindle e-ink model that was the size of an iPhone. Something small enough to fit into a pocket. I would love to be able to slide my eReader into my jeans pocket next to my iPhone and be able to take it out on the go whenever I want. A simple eink device for much easier on the go experiences.Don't get me wrong, the current device size is great. But it's too big for the on-the-go individual. A smaller, pocket sized eink kindle would be convenient and more fun to use.Thanks!

    pros: great size, light in weight, good battery life, screen easy to read, stores books for easy accesscon: unexplainable to me I occasionally do something when I‚Äôm reading and the kindle goes from where I‚Äôm reading to the end of the book and have a nearly impossible time returning to the place I started from.  I‚Äôve tried bookmarking pages so I can more easily find a spot I‚Äôve read but then I have difficulty accessing my bookmarks. The kindle needs navigation tools to more easily know where your at in the book and more easily refer back to previous read sections of the book.

    Great upgrade from the standard Kindle!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my new Kindle Paperwhite!Not long ago, I left my Kindle at home on a business trip. I struggled with the decision to upgrade and send the Paperwhite to my hotel, or to have my existing standard Kindle overnighted to me. Ultimately I had my existing Kindle shipped.I have come to regret that decision. I upgraded not long after that and the experience of the Paperwhite is well worth the extra cost. If you're stuck in a similarly priced conundrum: if you are deciding between the cheaper standard Kindle (or the cost to overnight one!) and the Paperwhite, the cost difference is marginal while the upgrades are palpable.There are many reviews of the Kindle Paperwhite from a new Kindle owner perspective. This review focuses on those who are considering upgrading from a standard Kindle to the Paperwhite and for those who are trying to choose between the two devices.It's easy to rationalize each and every feature of the Paperwhite as unnecessary. Technically, that is true. There is nothing the Paperwhite does compared to the standard Kindle that can be considered essential.But let's face it: Kindle's in general are not essential... they're just really nice to have.You might be wondering, for example, why you would want to read for an hour under 2 meters of water, save for preventing some accidental damage if you're reading in the bath. This, however, is an important and understated design feature. Though the IPX8 rating doesn't test for solid ingress, it would be hard to design a device to prevent liquid ingress and not prevent access of dust and debris.It is a strange decision to not test for a solid ingress rating, such as IP68. Amazon is burying the lead on this... the Kindle Paper White doesn't allow solid objects to get caught in the bezel. My former, standard, Kindle does. When a small particle of dust or pet hair gets caught in the bezel of my former Kindle, the screen does not register page swipes reliably. The bezel area in that Kindle is very thin and difficult to clean, which makes this issue difficult to resolve.The Kindle Paper White has no access to the bezel, the entire front is uniform. This is a major improvement in design and, in and of itself, represents a worthy reason to upgrade. This is the primary reason I wanted to move up to the Paper White. You can see in the photos the gap between the standard Kindle's bezel and screen that causes me some issues. If you plan on reading in the hot tub, there‚Äôs no comparison to be made between these two Kindles. I haven‚Äôt done so, but I imagine dropping the standard Kindle in the pool would result in far worse, irreversible damage than some dust on the screen, while the Paperwhite would suffer no damage at all.The other benefits to the Paper White were surprisingly nice, especially given that I hadn't initially considered them to be poignant at all. My favorite unexpectedly useful feature is the automatically adjustable variable light temperature setting. While it is nice to be able to make the Kindle's light warmer or cooler, it is much more practical to have this transition happen on a schedule. This way you can have a bright white light during the day, and have the backlight automatically turn to a soft warm light when reading at night. This prevents eye strain if you read to sleep and it an excellent feature.Other features that have improved on the Paperwhite:The fonts on the Paperwhite are smoother. The larger screen allows for more words on a page or a larger font size, allowing for a more pleasant experience. The page turns occur about twice as quickly on my new Paperwhite vs my former Kindle. The UI elements, for example accessing the menus or the Kindle store, are much more responsive on the Paperwhite.It would be harder to justify the price increase of the Oasis, as there don't seem to be any compelling advantages to that model over this one. The Paperwhite strikes an excellent value of features compared to pricing. Just be careful to get the most recent version, as some of the bundles contain older versions of this device.

    I enjoy using my kindle.  It‚Äôs small, light, and I can carry a whole room full of books in one small device.  The battery life is awesome.  Although the apps are pretty good, the paper white feature saves my eyes and I can read at the beach, in the sunshine, or even in the dark.  The only complaint is that there‚Äôs no good way to search your library without an internet connection. (Have I missed something?)  I‚Äôve had a kindle since they were first introduced and wouldn‚Äôt be without one.  I use my kindle when I‚Äôm out and away from internet - like camping or traveling.  Why can‚Äôt I just search for books on my device?  I gave it a 5 in spite of this drawback, simply because you do keep improving it and like I said, it‚Äôs my must pack for traveling.

    Software ruins hardware
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had Kindles for twelve years and the devices are good at what they do. The latest software update, however, is so bad that it genuinely makes me want to find a different ereader. Forcing an eink device to try and work like a tablet--taking away the simple lists of titles in favor of displaying book covers, making it impossible to quickly see what I'm looking for since now the screen can only show 5 books at a time--it's awful. I have hundreds of books, and the new design makes finding older ones impossible unless I can remember titles and authors to search directly. I have to assume this update was thought up by people who don't actually read much.

    I absolutely hate the newest update on Kindle software. I had to restart my kindle and it updated to an extremely unfriendly user format. If I put it in list format then books are interspersed with collections. If in collection view it‚Äôs a grid with junks up the screen with book covers and I can‚Äôt find anything. Plus series disappeared. I can‚Äôt figure it out. I was looked fir a book in a series, knew series name but not the book‚Äôs. After 20 minutes looking I had to go to Kindle store to find it. Although I gave almost 3,000 books I‚Äôm tempted to go to a different reader n my manufacturer.There should be a way to have any view be set as a grid or list view. I loved having a collection view followed by series and those books not in collections. Now in collection view they put ever No in a collection in a collection of Kindles making and I can‚Äôt find anything in it.I‚Äôve owned Kindles since the very first one was released. This is the worst update in all these years.

    Kobo Libra 2 vs Kindle Paperwhite (2021)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This review is for anyone who is debating between the new kindle Paperwhite and the Libra 2.If you are like me, you do extensive online research, obsess over reddit forums, YouTube reviews, etc... before making a decision on any electronic device that you buy. I probably watched every single YouTube review of Libra 2 and Paperwhite, and most reviewers said that both were basically equivalent.Well, I went ahead and bought both to try them, and here is what I liked/didnt like between the two:Observations:* Paperwhite is significantly lighter weight than the Libra 2. Although it is lighter, it is a lot harder/straining to hold than the Libra 2. Because the size bezels are thin, it is really un-ergonomic hold with your thumb right on the edge. Or you can hold it from the bottom, but that becomes awkward after about 30-45mins too. The Libra 2 however, is heavier, but has a, IMO, much more ergonomic grip and has space to put your thumb. This allows your other fingers to grip the device from the back much easier.* The way Libra 2 formats the text on the screen is better than Paperwhite. It also allows for a few more customizations which, for me, make huge differences. Libra 2 allows you to put the position of where you are in the chapter and the chapter name at the top of the screen. It also allows you to display your position in the entire book at the bottom of the device. For kindle, it just has a couple options of showing how much time you have left in the chapter, and how much time of reading is left in the book at the very bottom left. You don't know how many times I accidentally tap on the screen and lose where am in the book. With kindle, I have no idea what page I am on when I accidentally tap on the page. On the Libra 2, I see the page numbers and its super easy to re-orient myself.* Everyone says the screen quality between the kindle and libra are equivalent. I one million percent disagree. Libra 2 display is WAY more crisp and clear. The dark mode on Libra 2 is leagues better than paperwhite. When you look at them side by side, it is obvious that the Libra 2 screen is better. My wife also looked at both and instantly noticed how much better the Libra 2 screen is. It is seriously unbelievable how crisp it is.* The whole ADS on the Kindle leaves such a sour taste in my mouth. I hate the fact that the Kindle shows ads and you have to pay to remove them. And even when you remove them, their homepage still has all the kindle store recommendations shoved up your face. Libra's interface is so much lighter. It just displays your books and that's basically it. I like that.* People say that both devices are equally responsive. I disagree. There isn't a HUGE difference, but there is a noticeable difference in Libra 2 being faster than Kindle. When I want to go back into the Home Screen (exit out of a book) the Libra 2 does it within 1 second. Kindle takes 2+ seconds to go back to the home page. I also notice Kindle does a lot more flashing and redrawing than Libra. I don't know if I can scientifically prove that though, its just my observation, so take that with a grain of salt.* Libra 2 has reading statistics for you. Its a really minor thing, but I really like it. I like to see how long I've read, how fast I read, etc, and Libra has a nice interface to see that. It is kind of like the Apple Watch fitness tracking, where you can go into the app and see all the workouts you have done. Its not required, but its nice to see your progress and makes you motivated to keep going.* I really like the Kindle's dictionary and flashcards feature. Anytime you look up a word on Kindle, it automatically saves it and you can go to all the words you've looked up and run them in a flashcards word define game. On the Libra, you can also save words for the dictionary, but there is no flashcard game.* I haven't really used the Kobo app, but the kindle app I think is really amazing. The syncing between the Kindle app and the kindle device is great. I don't know if the kobo device have that, but I think Kindle just wins on this front. I don't read on my phone, so its not a huge deal for me.* Kindle uses a proprietary format it uses for the books. Libra does not-- it just uses the `epub` format.You can use what you find most important and purchase that. Both devices are really good at what they do, but I personally find the Libra 2 a much more bang for your buck, and an overall better device for me.I hope you find this useful!

    The new software STINKS
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    As others have said, the new software STINKS.On my old Kindle 2, I could see TEN books listed on the screen.On my PW after the update, I only see FOUR books !!!!!  Geez talk about going backwards.For a collection with 200 books, this goes from 10 pages on the Kindle-2 to 50 pages on the PW !!!!The only thing that makes this workable is the addition of a scroll bar.  With the scroll bar, I can use the bar to move through the MANY pages of books, rather than page through them one page at a time.  Even so, using the scroll bar is difficult in LARGER collections with more than 100 books.This is like Windows vs. DOS.Yeah windows is easier to learn and looks friendly, but DOS was more efficient and faster.We need an option to select a higher book per screen list mode display.Secondly, the PW performance can be sluggish, to the point that the PW sometimes seems to have hung, and the only way to do anything is to do a hard restart of the PW.What solved this problem was to turn Airplane mode ON, thus turning WiFi OFF.  With WiFi OFF the PW performance is reasonable.So, it appears that the PW is ""calling home to Amazon a LOT,"" and using up a lot of the processing power of the PW, leaving little left for you.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Unfortunately, I am once again(3rd time) going to have to replace my kindle reader.  The charger ports seem to have a built in obsolescence.  I read--a LOT. Therefore I need to charge this a lot.  If all of our phones can be charged daily without the charging ports becoming worn out, the Amazon can produce a better product.  Replace the charging ports with better quality--or fix them for us when they wear out!!!

    A reasonable tool - until the last software update.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Since the last software update (Spring 2022) my Kindle Paperwhite has been unbearably slow when switching between books or moving around my library. It's fine to read from once you're in a book, as long as you don't want to move around inside the book - that is slow too. (Also, the removal of the Back button in the upgrade before last makes it much more difficult, eg to skip ahead in a book or look up some plot point in an earlier book in the same series, then get back to where you were reading.)Capacity is good (I have well over a thousand books on my Kindle), screen resolution and readability are great, so this really is a case of a poorly-thought-out software ""upgrade"" greatly decreasing the usability of an otherwise excellent device. I was an early adopter and have owned a number of different Kindle models, so I can report that this slowdown is a new change.

    BUY AN OLD ONE
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had several Kindles. The older ones are best. The new software is terrible. You used to be able to buy a book & hit download. Now, it may or may not download. It may be just in the cloud. Then you have to fool around to find it & get it sent to your device. Also, the library pages stink. Keep scrolling down to find your books. You can't just flip pages quickly. Scrolling takes forever when you have 100's of books you're browsing. Lastly, it's SLOW. Before I could turn pages quickly while reading. Not anymore. It's a wait while the pages load. Kindle...go back to what you did well.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Two devices help organize my life - my iPhone and my 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite.  The former keeps me connected, too much so, and the latter allows me to disconnect except when I want targeted connection on a book - whenever and wherever.  I thought I would upgrade the Kindle after 8 years of excellent service, but it was not to be.  The 11th generation has a better screen and view, but the control over connection is gone.  You have to be tethered to WiFi, and you have to endure a home screen that connects you to ads posing as recommendations.  Sure, you can choose, for the time being, to have the device open on the library page and avoid the recommendations, but I suspect it won‚Äôt be long before that changes as well. Amazon, I don‚Äôt understand.  I am going to buy books from the store anyway.  Why annoy me like this?  And why make it harder to buy books by making me find a WiFi connection?  The beauty of my old device is that I can go from a sample to the full book anytime, anywhere by pressing a button.  That‚Äôs why I am keeping it and returning the upgrade.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Bought this at Best Buy, there was no mention on the price tag, in the advertising at the display kiosk, or at the sales counter that this was ""ad supported."" Maybe some users wouldn't find the ads annoying. I found them super annoying and assumed it was something I could turn off. Turns out I have to pay to turn off ads. So now after buying a device at what I was made to believe was it's full price, with no mention of any limitations, I have to pay an additional $20 to remove ads. Pretty disgusting way to sell a product, honestly. I'll never recommend this device to anyone for that reason. If it had just been mentioned upfront I would have had no problem at all just paying $20 more at the time of the sale.It works fine if you want to read stuff, the screen is pleasant, size is good, battery seems fine, but I'd recommend literally any other device on the market after that really gross sales experience.

Now, what shows up is a list with the slowest scrolling i have ever seen.  What happened to the easy-to-use and handy access we used to have??  If i don't remember the EXACT title of a book, i can't get to it by typing it in Search. So that means the tedious time-consuming scrolling.I am a senior citizen, and there may be a way to change it back, or a way to get to my books easily -- but I don't know how to do it.  And the present system is not user friendly enough to be able to figure it out.Please simplify access to paperwhite content!  -- and/or take it back to having our 3 most recent books easy to get to, and other books not hidden in a list which is so time consuming to navigate!

    I was happy with my paperwhite for almost two years. It is perfect for reading outside in direct sunlight. Battery life is amazing. Then one day it decides to flip pages, change font size, highlight text, add bookmarks, restart, and shut down. After restarting the whole process would start again. Imagine trying to read a book like this! I could then go for a few days with it being a normal reader, but soon enough I'd be back to Satan taking control. I called to talk to amazon chat who told me to do a factory reset. Did that then the touchscreen no longer worked. Now I am left with a paperwhite stuck on a lock screen that moves its cursor all around the screen on its own and no way for me to control it. But Allan at amazon offered me 15% off a NEW reader (not a used one) to go through this torment all over again. I have been a prime customer for a million years. I have 600 kindles. Do I need another one? I would gladly return all of them to amazon if they gave me ONE that worked.

I would definitely recommend reading on an iPad if you have one. I have never tried it on another type of tablet, but my guess it's probably better as well.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Imagine you have hundreds of documents in a folder on your computer and you want to scroll through them.  Now imagine the only way you can scroll through them is by viewing their document icons in a grid pattern, rather than just being able to read the file names from top to bottom.  Well, that's what you'll have to do if you buy the latest Kindle Paperwhite.If you've bothered to create Collections to organize your books, forget them.  They'll still be there, but you won't be able to view them in List format.  Instead, you'll be forced into a glacially slow scroll through grids of book covers from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, squinting to read the book titles amidst all the useless graphic nonsense.  It used to be that you could opt out of this obnoxious view and manually switch back to List view, but for some reason, Amazon has taken that option away.  What an amazingly bad decision in an age where Accessibility is a by-word.I can't fathom why they did this.  Do they think they're somehow going to turn my black-and-white Kindle into some kind of dazzling display of artistic wonder?  Do they think they're going to sell me more books by enticing me with pictures of books that I already own?Whatever.  Amazon appears to have embraced the ""we know better than you, and your preferences are meaningless"" attitude that is endemic in today's tech world.  If I were you, I wouldn't buy a Kindle until they've stopped trying to control your navigation preferences.  I mean, look at your bookshelves at home.  You have a system, right?  Whatever that system is, you know right where to go to find what you're in the mood to read, and all you have to do is go to that section and peruse the titles on the spines.  If someone came along and messed with your system...if they told you could no longer organize by genre and that you must place your books so the full cover displays instead of just the spines...what would you tell them?  I'm guessing it would involve at least one curse word.In summary, I'd recommend holding off on your purchase.  Wait until the Masters of the Universe have figured out that you, the customer, actually matter in this equation.  And I'd recommend not holding your breath.

I was offered the consolation price of a 20% discount on getting myself a new kindle.So basically, things are done so cheaply now that I am just supposed to throw away a device that should be able to be easily fixed.  What is it with this throw away culture??  How is it that the only advice to fix something is to restart?  That's what I used to do 20 years ago as a lab assistant in college, there has to be a smarter answer than restart or throw away.

I kept receiving error messages from Amazon that there was a problem with the document I was sending.I keep finding books I placed in collections listed as ""uncollected"" on my devices 4, 5, & 6, all the newer devices. I find books and docs sent to 2 devices when I sent to 1.Preorders and new purchases/free books through Amazon, I choose which device to send it, amazon has been sending to my default one instead and I have to go into my account each time and remove from one device and/or send to correct device.In addition, you can't just ""remove from device"" on the device, noooo, that doesn't work properly or isn't even an option anymore.Honestly, quit improving because all that's happening is alot of crap showing up on devices that cannot be changed.

The library page numbers have been removed; To remove a book from the kindle reader, you must now permanently delete the book, meaning to read it later you must pay for it again. Now the books you have already read are on your kindle along with your unread books. Sloppy programing making the kindle experience frustrating.

    Terrible battery life and keeps crashing!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Ok, so I think I may be on one of those game shows, where I'm being ""played"" a fool or ""pranked"". LOL! (trying to keep a sense of humor with this). I posted a review about a day ago--which interestingly has since been deleted by an ""unknown"" person. In the review I cited issues with the battery life being terrible (12 hours at best), and the browser being like a play from a movie about technology in 1984. :-) Anyways, I got an email from Amazon asking if I'd like to chat with a representative to share more info. I replied, ""sure"". I spoke with an agent (not to be named, I am NOT in this to get someone into trouble--this is a company issues, not a client service tech issue).  I explained the issue with my paperwhite--it gets pretty minimal usage. The battery lasts for no MORE then 12 hours--when on a FULL charge and not being used. The client service rep and I had a good laugh, and agreed that I now have a $200 paper weight. LOL! Get the pun?? Hahahha! Anyways, sucks to be me, feel like a need a background song by the Fugees (killing me softly), to sooth my sad wounds. Maybe I should just have more wine at this point. So, after the call I get ANOTHER email from Amazon. Dare say I think I may have a chance at some form of client service ""caring"". I get a guy on the phone who is LITERALLY ""Varashunu"" from SouthPark. (see link below).  He says ""how can I help you"" and I repeat that THEY had called me. That my Kindle Paperwhite is a POS and won't hold a charge. He says how long do I keep it on? I say, it won't stay on for longer then 12 hours--when NOT even being used. He said that is 100% normal. I had that's complete BS--the advertisement shows 48 hours. This is NOT normal. He replies, (i think this is what he said) you are just ""s**t out of luck, lady"". And, then I hang up the phone.  I'm now laughing out loud, while drinking my delish new glass of chardonnay.  With a $200 paperwhite device being used as a paperweight.So, all is well--back to the same place I was. Sadly, Amazon does NOT stand behind their products. And, they are now staffing members of the SouthPark cast.

    The more they try and make a Kindle like a tablet the less reason I have to own a Kindle
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have to say over all, I love my Kindle, the first one I owned lasted me 8 years before I needed a new one and I use the new one pretty much every day. however over the last several updates it seems that Amazon wants to make my Kindle look and behave more like a tablet and less like a book. I mainly use my Kindle because it feels more like a book to me. but I guess Amazon feels they know what is best so I don't need a way to revert to a older look and feel. not to mention the so called Home screen they have crammed in that looks like my Amazon home page on my PC where they can ""recommend"" books each time I open my Kindle, and even though I have paid to not receive ads. Yes I know the actual ads are far worse and more intrusive. but if you are going to recommend a book, wait until I am shopping for one  and do not push it in my face every time I read.

    Good Performance, Poor Interface
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    First the good.  The anti-glare screen is quite good. Off angle viewing is not a problem and you can set the brightness to any reasonable level. The font changing is easy and THE biggest selling point IMO. For those of us with old eyes, using a big font makes a big difference. The battery life really IS impressive, even if you view with the brightness turned all the way up.  Now the bad. The interface needs completely overhauled. Something so simple as accessing your library is ridiculously difficult. AMAZON should take a page from the iPhone and have the equivalent of a ""home button"". It's actually easier to turn the device off and turn it back on than to navigate to your library. A larger Kindle has been the dream of just about everyone that has ever owned one but AMAZON refuses to consider this. I have no idea why. They'd make an ever bigger mountain of gold.

    Review of Update Spring 2022, not device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The most recent update makes searching for previously purchased, downloaded content take much, much longer than it used to. This is extremely frustrating to longtime Kindle users.  This is due to several changes:1. Because of the pictures of the books, only 4 items can be displayed on the screen in a list at one time. So one has to get through more screens to even read through a list. It would be GREAT if there could be an option in ""Library View"" to not show the cover picture icons.2. Previously, in ""Library View"" collections were (or could be) listed together at the top of a list, with un-collected items below ordered based on recent usage. After the update, items are listed (again, just 4 at a time) as collections and both collected (in a collection) and uncollected items in, for example, ""recently used"" order. The very frustrating thing is that both the item and the collection that item is in are listed as separate items on the screen. This means that if the two most recent items read were from 2 different  collections, from the main ""Library"" screen, one sees just those items and the collections they belong to, because the display now only holds 4 items at at time.3. There is a scrolling arrow button on the side of the screen to help with scrolling, which is a much more frequent task now that one can only see 4 items in a list at a time. When going back to ""Library"" after reading something, the list is not reordered until one goes back to the top (keep tapping that arrow) of the list. It would be better, for the ""Library"" function, to get rid of the pictures and this arrow - allowing  only 2 lines for information about any item. Being able to view 8 items at a time (instead of just 4) would cut the need for scrolling in half.It seems that the update was created by a person or people who have not used Kindles very much.  The redesigned interface seems more appropriate for larger, brightly backlit, shiny color screens like iPads, not for much-easier-on-the-eyes-for-serious-readers e-readers. The re-designation of ""Home"" in the previous update as a marketing tool was not overly bothersome since what was previously ""Home"" got the new label of ""Library"" and worked basically the same way the former ""Home"" used to.  However, the most recent update has made even the ""Library"" view awkward and slow to use.Many long-time Kindle users have extensive libraries and keep hundreds of items on their Kindle e-readers all the time. This was the case even before the major memory upgrades that allow e-book fans to easily carry even MORE titles around with them. It is hoped that a new update will come out soon either restoring the previous ""Library"" view or at least allowing for simpler searching of large libraries.I love my Kindle, and I hope that the very serious problems with the most recent update will be fixed soon. I would be delighted to help whatever team is responsible for this improve the Kindle experience.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have had this Kindle for less than a year, and it is already failing. When I open the store to browse for books, it repeatedly glitches and gives an error message. It will refuse to select certain categories, or refuse to scroll, or just go to error. I have restarted it many times, and did factory reset. The worst part is when I contacted support, they just told me to restart/reset, then I should just trade it in and get a new one! Talk about disposable junk attitude. They don't even expect it to last a year, or offer true support. Just throw it away and buy another if it glitches. ""Support"" seemed to know nothing, like how to help me check if it was updating.I really hate companies that design things to be landfill, forcing you to constantly replace. If they cared about quality, they would at least provide decent support.

    Great for reading, reading a zillion books, but  their interface is a huge waste of time
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    1) My now antique Paperwhite does nothing to automatically organize a book series into a author/book collection., it‚Äôs up to me.  Viewing a book collection online is no better. How come, the information is stored in a database?  2) Kindle makes me manually corral book series into a collection and once done are ordered by name order, not book order.  A huge time waster. Almost always, but not always Amazon list the book number but often that IS NOT visible when ordering a book and more often it IS NOT visible when you are deciding which book to read next on the Kindle making it necessary to read Amazon online descriptions, open the last read book to see their ‚Äúread next‚Äù message or open individual books to calculate what must be the first or next book in the series.  I just spent 4 hours organizing a collection instead of everything that is more enjoyable. Yes, I‚Äôm a little resentful and I still haven‚Äôt organized everything.  3) All books should  automatically show Author, book name, collection name, book number ordered by Author, collection name, book number. 4) Books in collections that have unread books (<99% read in a book) should show on the collection screen ‚ÄúNew‚Äù to indicate one or more books in the series is unread.  If your programmers have TiVo, tell them to emulate it. 4) When purchasing Kindle book, Amazon should provide the option to purchase the entire series followed by the ability to purchase each book listed by book order, not NAME order. 5) Stop lying to me, when I purchase a book or use the synchronize option give me the book.  I HATE, HATE being in an airplane and find that some of my books aren‚Äôt on the Kindle.  I always what my book immediately download and I always want everything synchronized but yet you still fool me. 6) When a new book in a series is released, put an icon on my book list indicating a new book can be purchased.  Allow me to navigate to my book series list, see the suggested book‚Äôs name and purchase the book by selecting the buy now icon.  Come on Amazon management, let the programmers do what they knew should have been don 5 years ago.

    Kindle users beware, some times Amazon updates your reader and does not test it.  This last update removed the back button from the menu so when reading a study bible if you hit a foot noted word it takes you to the scripture location as required so you can follow.  THE ISSUE: if you did NOT intend to select the footnote you CANNOT get back to your page unless you go back to the contents and start the chapter over.  Now that sucks because now instead of a smooth flow in reading you have to not only remember the chapter you are on but where you were in the chapter.  AMAZON: Do not update something that works well.  I have enjoyed the use of my kindle this is my second but now they need to fix the error and timely updates are not a priority for a conglomerate industry.  Jeff B should look into this if not his main tech CIO should or they will be getting back the kindles broken out of frustration.

    All good things must come to an end
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Within the next few months I will be upgrading to my 5th e-reader and my go to option was always the Paperwhite--until now. Late in 2021, Kindle came out with a new user interface. Unlike the previous version, the new design is not intuitive, it is cumbersome, and frankly, nothing more than a blatant marketing ploy to force readers into KU & one-click purchases.~For all of my previous Paperwhites, I had paid to remove the ads, but now it doesn't seem to make any difference because the home screen is now littered with ""suggested"" books for me to purchase.~Prior to the newer version, the home page always took you back to the first page of your library with your most recent read at the top. No more.~Although this was an inconvenience, the real sticking point for me was the removal of the back button. That was by far the best feature of the Paperwhite. Loved it. Gone.Suddenly, lo and behold, a couple of weeks ago, Kindle uploaded a bug fix.~In this version it now shows the thumbnail of each book cover in the library list. What a waste of resources! The text is not legible on the covers and the photos are grayscale-pixelated blobs.~The new layout only allows you to vertically scroll to review your library list. This serves two purposes, I suppose. First, it forces the reader to use both hands to operate the Kindle, because, ergonomically, you can no longer swipe the screen horizontally with your thumb to advance the page. Secondly, because the covers create a larger surface area, when scrolling the reader is constantly opening books by accident. This usually occurs once every one or two pages.~Finally, the most egregious offense is that the development team, once again, left behind back button. That is a deal breaker. If it would have been re-instituted with the latest update, all would have been forgiven and I would have continued to purchase Paperwhites.As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.

You can only see the first 4-5 books, so now have multiple pages to surf through.  Previous changes also make it harder to turn off wi fi to preserve battery life (adding more steps/touches) and making it more difficult to discern library rentals from owned books when deleting from device.

It won't respond to forced reboot.  It won't respond to anything.  After leaving it sit idle for four days, it appeared to heal itself.  I started reading the book where I'd left off.  Worked great for all of 15 minutes, then the print began to fade out and it wouldn't respond to touch controls again.  When it works, it's great.

I have over a thousand books on my paperwhite. I have most of them sorted into collections. I want them to BE in the collection. I do not want to see them outside of whatever collection *I* put them in. Currently it shows you either only some collections not even all of them, OR everything all jumbled up and in one huge list. I spent hour's sorting and organizing so I knew just where every book was but now all that is gone. This is a huge step backward and now I have $$$$$ tied up in books I can't use/find to read.

    I totally agree with one-star reviewers DCNative and Lindar, this version is a serious disappointment. It took me weeks, as a devoted non-techie (till not sure the purpose of a USB port or where to find one), to figure out how to get WiFi (which is yet another monthly ""fee"" I was happier to avoid), and now I have to re-download everything from my old Kindle because nothing that was allegedly transferred is accessible. The Search feature is impossible to use because the keyboard is mostly unresponsive, and my personal opinion is that a user should not be obligated to jump through a bunch of hoops to suit some nerdy programmer who just wants to see if he's capable of performing some esoteric function to soothe their own ego. ""Improvements"" like these are specifically initiated solely to force Kindle users to buy another device to replace what they already had that was perfectly functional and suited their comfort level, just like getting stuck with a book that turns out to be a cliffhanger. Wise up, Kindle, and good luck to any manufacturer who can come up with an e-reader and doesn't have the ulterior motive of forcing customers to upgrade when they don't want or need to.

    New UX is terrible
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My Kindle Paperwhite just received a UX upgrade, and I find it to be terrible: in List view, it now uses thumbnails, which means that only 4 items are displayed per a page, which in turn means that scrolling through your items takes at least twice as long. This is very bad if you, like me, have hundreds of times and scroll through them frequently. Amazon believes that it knows better than you what you need and / or want, so there is not an option to go back to the older view or to at least get rid of the thumbnails.Given this, I suggest that you use the Kindle app on your smartphone rather than buy a Kindle Paperwhite: the UX format is basically the same, but there's better performance and it's easier to use on a smartphone. (At least on a Samsung S9.)

As far as bringing anything else up once I finally do get into Wikipedia - forget it.Additionally, I can't go thru the pages of my Library and get back to page one by hitting the home icon - I have to click on the page number at the bottom and go thru that whole process. I don't know how many times I have been using the search function while I was reading and mistakenly hit the back arrow icon instead of X (maybe it's the other way around ...) and left the book I was reading instead of going back to my original page.When I deregistered my 2nd Kindle, I didn't know that I could still read what I had loaded on to it, and I would like to reregister it and load on more, but I'm afraid Amazon would update it like it has my 3rd Kindle.I doubt that you are going to change the things that I have complained about but thank you for the opportunity to voice my displeasure.

    What happened to my KIndle???
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    All the sudden my Kindle became a different device POOF! The home page is completely different and I CAN'T STAND IT! HATE IT! I want my old home screen back. Whoever decided on this needs to lose their job, Jeff. The home page is essentially an unending ad! I didn't buy a Kindle with ads.And there are the other problems I thought I could learn to live with, but really hate. First, how come every generation of Kindle does less than the one before? My Gen 2 had lots of games on it that would not transfer to the old Paperwhite. Now the new Paperwhite will not support any of my games at all. Then there is the tricky, inconsistent touch screen. Sometimes I have to touch three times to get a page to turn. But scrolling through the menus is so touchy that I am constantly opening things I don't want to open. And why does it take so much longer to wake up? The battery does not last as long either. And the battery life indicator on mine has malfunctioned to the point the Kindle essentially shut itself down for lack of power when the indicator said I had 54% power left!It was a big mistake to ""upgrade"" to this new Kindle. The trajectory of Kindles is NOT improving.UPDATE: After two weeks with the new Home page/operating system I can say I completely and utterly despise it. It is intrusive and annoying and there's no getting rid of it. Again, this ploy to try to push content at me is despicable. The way my current book is displayed aggravates me entirely. I HATE IT!!! If I had not invested years and thousands of dollars into Kindle books I would throw the whole thing away today and go back to 100% hard copy books. Yes, I am that outraged!!!

    I was hoping the Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation would be an improvement over previous Kindles.  I have owned 5 kindles, plus purchased others as gifts.  My reason for wanting a new Kindle is that  the interface is difficult to use.  Specifically, the response time is slow or does not respond at all to my touch commands.  I would happily purchase a new Kindle, if the interface were brought up to modern standards.  Unfortunately, reviews of indicate there is no improvement to the interface software.

    Amazon advertises that you can save 20% on a new device if you trade in an old one. I did this and was told my device did not qualify for the promo discount, but they did give me $5 so I know my trade in was accepted. Very misleading.This is what is promoted: ""4. Once your trade-in is complete, an Amazon.com Gift Card equal to an appraised value of your old device(s), PLUS a promotional discount towards any new qualifying Kindle e-reader, will be automatically applied to your account. Promotional discount is limited to one per customer"".After searching for more info on the trade in program, Amazon uses a different term: YOU MAY ALSO""If your submission is eligible for, and you choose to participate in, Instant Payment for your trade-in items, you will receive Amazon.com Gift Card(s) in the amount of the trade-in value at the time you submit a trade-in. You may also receive a limited-time promotional credit towards the purchase of a new qualifying Amazon Device"".

    I enjoyed my old kindle so much, I gave up real books.  However, after years of use, that kindle stopped downloading books, so last October, I bought a replacement.

    I have enjoyed my PaperWhite for library books and other purchases. But I have recently been completely soured on all Amazon kindle products because I bought a book written by a friend that was offered as formatted for Kindle, but could never get it to download to my device.

My original one is a small sized device but still works with no aggravation. Ditto for my second NOOK which also has lasted through many many readings without problems. My son felt the KINDLE might be an improvement because of its brightness and size. How wrong we were.This device freezes frequently in the middle of use. It then requires a waiting period and a complete restart to be used. Often the restart puts you back on page 1 and you must turn pages until you find where you were cut off. So frustrating!Time to go back to using the NOOK.

Once I got it I was struck by the blacker type and its faster speed.  I love it.You may have read on the internet that the Kids version is the same as the Adults but is considerably less expensive.  Maybe so but not on Black Friday when I ordered mine.Minor quibble:  I'm not sure the instruction manual is up to date.  The first book I read on my new Kindle showed all the underlinings from other readers and I didn't know how to clean them off.  I also like seeing the time on each page but it was only on the home page.  I couldn't find answers in the manual.  I contacted Amazon on line and a very helpful customer service person showed me what to do.  (Click on the Aa settings.)  All is now well and I'm happy.

    A very worthy upgrade if you‚Äôre coming from the 7th Gen(2015)
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this thing. To be fair, I loved my old kindle too, but this was definitely worth upgrading for. It is everything the product description says it is, no need to repeat that here. My old 2015 7th gen was working 100% but I was tempted when I saw that the new ones had warm amber lighting. It‚Äôs a small thing, but I read mostly at night, in bed, in the dark, while my SO sleeps, and this really does make reading easier on my eyes. And on that point it‚Äôs great. The touchscreen is also a drastic improvement over the 7th gen.The size surprised me. The product descriptions make it clear that this one is about a quarter inch taller and wider, which I didn‚Äôt love, though I definitely do love the bigger screen. But what wasn‚Äôt clear until I had it in hand is that they took back most of that increase with a more minimalist case! So comparing the two products in the case, the new one is the exact same height, about an eighth of an inch wider, and it‚Äôs actually noticeably thinner. I haven‚Äôt taken my old one out of its case in six years, so if you‚Äôre like me then don‚Äôt worry about this, they are are effectively the same size.I can also report, as others have noted, that if you buy the bundle the items ship separately. So the shipping time listed for the bundle is NOT accurate. If you want to know when you‚Äôll get them, look to the individual product pages, those were accurate for me. The bundle said 3-5 weeks, but I got my case in two days, the kindle arrived in four days, and apparently the charging block (I.e. the most useless piece of the bundle) it the only item that will take 3-5 weeks to arrive.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've always loved to read but hadn't really even considered a Kindle. I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. With the ability to checkout books from the library, it's so easy to finish a book and pick up another. I went from reading maybe 3 books a year to having read 5 last month.It's so lightweight that it is easy to hold in whatever position you're most comfortable in. The backlight is excellent in the brightest sunlight or in the darkest room. I'll be transparent - if I didn't use this primarily with library books that are coming and leaving my library, the library portion of the Kindle could be slightly annoying just because you can't freely scroll.It's not worth it to pay the extra money for the ads. It's literally just books being recommended when the screen is locked, and if you buy the leather case for it, it'll be covered up.I love mine and think it's worth every penny!

    This is such a clear upgrade from the 2018 edition! I was a bit skeptical at first because I bought the 2018 paperwhite during the prime sale in October 2020. However, I caved in for the better battery, the warm light and bigger screen.What I like so far:The screen is noticeable bigger and it feels strange but a good strange because I love it!I really love how much more responsive the screen is for this e reader! Doesn't seem so cluncky!I love the adjustable warm light feature! You can set the time for warm light automatic or you can manually changed the time!Brightness! This paperwhite clearly is much brighter compared to the the 2018 paperwhite!USB-C charging and wireless charging ( paperwhite signature edition)! Though I wouldn't upgrade to this paperwhite for this feature alone but it's an awesome plus because I swear I have like 20 USB-C cords and like no micro USB cords. With nearly every device using USB-C, this feature is a really good perk!Battery life! Amazon claims 10 weeks with 30 mintues of reading each day. I can comment on the battery life personally for me yet. However, I expect even witu reading for 60-90 mintues, you probably won't have to charge it but once a month! Which is still amazing!!I think the only cons I have about this paperwhite is no option for other colors. I would like to have a choice of a few different colors. Another con is there isn't a 32 gb option for the standard option. You'd have to get the signature edition for the extra storage.Overall, this upgrade is worth the extra $10!!!

    Traded in my Paperwhite from many years ago. This one is even better. Still about the same weight and size but screen area is a bit larger. Screen is more responsive. The viewing is clean and crisp. Battery life is awesome. I have it in a slim case, so it‚Äôs very portable. Would definitely recommend.

    I finally decided to upgrade from the Kindle Keyboard 3rd Gen, and I am so glad I did. The new paperwhite Kindle is light and a joy to read on. I love how responsive the screen is, and how quickly the pages turn. I didn‚Äôt think I would need or like the backlight but its actually proving quite handy (and still feels better than reading on other backlit devices like phones or tablets).

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Originally I ordered the kindle fire 7, but after realizing that I really only wanted the kindle for reading and not the internet or games I decided to cancel the order and get the paperwhite. The battery life is the biggest plus for me! I‚Äôm someone who reads for hours upon hours at a time so the kindle fire with its 7 hours of battery life just wasn‚Äôt going to cut it! I am so in love with my new kindle. If you‚Äôre someone who reads often or in different lighting I would definitely recommend getting a kindle instead of a fire tablet. The paper finish is so much easier on the eyes than the tablet screen. It also has warm light and a night mode for an even more enjoyable experience. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! The only thing I wish it came with is a charging block. With the price point it seems like they could easily include one, but overall it is worth every penny!

    I tried again 5/15 with Japanese text.  After two pages, page would not turn.  After a minute, it restarted.  Finally, it went back to open page.  When I tried to open my Japanese book again, blank screen.  I will have to manually restart.  Since the Japanese text is the main reason I got the new Kindle, I have to give it a 1 and go back to my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite.Twice I had to close the cover to shut down the device, when it stopped responding.  Once, I had to reset it, when the Japanese book I was reading did not open and could not be removed from the device.  But, it  opens books clearly faster than my kindle 10th. It seems to have settled down, but I am keeping the shipping package just in case I decide to return it.9/4/22Still freezing and re-booting way to often.  The 2018 Paperwhite is no better.  I never used to have this problem.  Did they update the operating system or something.  I love my Kindles, but since they started acting  up so much, I am beginning to lose faith in them.

    I am so happy to have gotten this black Friday deal !  I mainly use it for at home reading and night reading! Reading with the warmlight was the selling point for me because I used to read on my Kindle app for this purpose!  I love the schedule warmlight  it's huge for my little hands so I put a popsocket on it to hold! From the picture you can see I have the 2018 paperwhite it's more portable  being that it's smaller  my only con and it doesn't happen often enough is sometimes it freezes and restart and randomly upgrading it's system  but that doesn't bother me I hope in the future will be fixed! I can definitely say that I don't think I'll want the oasis because this is bigger than my  hand and  warmlight is all I desired!  Now my boyfriend wants a kindle since I love my devices so much

    Large Screen. 100% Better than reading on a Tablet!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Buy a kindle don't settle for a tablet for reading. I've compared them all, wondered whether I would need a bigger screen or whether i'll feel like i'm holding a book. I wanted to know if i'd feel like a good replacement for an actual book reader. I nearly bought a 300$ ink tablet cause I just wanted a larger screen. Then the paper white got upgraded and I though I'd give it a try. I wouldn't come back on my decision. Reading feels effortless. In the dark, in the car or at work. It's luxury really. If you can afford to. Just do it. You won't regret it.

    This is my first Kindle and so clearly I am enjoying the fact that I don't need a book light and I don't have to bend the book out to keep the pages open and it's lightweight.  The only complaint I have so far is the battery.  They said the battery lasts 10 weeks depending on how much you read.  I am guessing that it lasts that long if you have it but don't read it at all.  I have owned this Kindle for 5 days and have already had to plug it in twice to charge it.  Granted I have been totally immersed into a series and have barely put the Kindle down,  except for one day I didn't read that much out of it.  But saying it should hold a battery for 10 weeks makes me think that the battery should at least hold for a week of continuous reading.

    An Excellent Paperwhite Update
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    As promised, I am updating this review, now that I have had a few weeks to play with the device.  My rating has changed from 4 to 5 starts, because of the firmware update to version 5.14.1.1 from 5.14.1.  Only a minor update based on version number change, but I have not had lockup issues since the update.  I do not expect to be using my old Paperwhite 2018 again.  I think this is a real winner.I frequently buy discounted books and have since 2009.  The 590 books downloaded take 2.64 GB of the total 6.23 GB available.  So for most people this 8 GB model (the Operating System must take about 1.7 GB) should have more than enough storage.------------------------------------------------------My Kindle Paperwhite 2021 just arrived.Initial impressions.1. It is noticeably faster flipping pages than my Paperwhite 2018.  I put the old and new Paperwhites side by side in the photo with the old one on the left and the new on the right.  I set the font and display formats the same and flipped through a book.  Tapping on them simultaneously, the  delay changing pages is quite obvious on the old model and almost non-existent on the new.  Rapidly tapping the right edge of the 2021 twice flips through 2 pages.  Doing the same thing on the 2018 it only flips one page.  Responsiveness is rapid and accurate moving forward and backwards.  Superior to the 2018.2. The larger active area is very nice.  With a ruler I measure an area increase of about 33%.3. It charges faster than the old Paperwhite.  It arrive with 60% charge and it quickly charged to 90%.4. It booted up with latest Kindle software: Version 5.14.1 (October 2021).  My old Paperwhite 2018 is running version 5.13.7 for comparison.5. It is nice having the display warmth control in addition to the brightness.6. I have had 2 lockups where the only way I could unfreeze was to hold the power button down until it rebooted.  That is the reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5.  The problem occurred when playing with settings and might have something to do with setting extremes on the new Warmth slider and Brightness.  I suspect it is going into the sleep mode improperly, because the screen lighting dimmed, but the page still displayed yet would not change when tapping left or right.  I am guessing Amazon will fix this soon at which point I will raise my rating.My review headline understates the improvement in the Paperwhite.  I own both the 2016 and 2018 models and this is a much more significant set of updates than between the earlier models.  For me, the larger active screen and page turning speed are a big deal.I look forward to using the new Paperwhite and updating this review.

    Warm light feature alone makes it worth the upgrade
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had some version of a Kindle for just about as long as they've been around; as an avid reader I wouldn't be without one now.  I received my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen 8 GB version last week and have already downloaded hundreds of books onto it; knowing I'll never be stuck somewhere without something to read is an amazing feeling, since the larger size still fits into my medium sized purse. I'd worried some about that!Aside from the capacity, my favorite feature hands-down is being able to adjust the warm light depending on the light in the room.  Looking at a bright screen can tire out my eyes and give me headaches, and in a dark room the harsh contrast can really bother my eyes to the point I have to stop reading.  The warm light option has a wide adjustment range and is just perfect for people with sensitive eyes.I was also surprised how ""normal"" the larger size felt shortly after I started using it - more like a book as far as number of words per page - and that it's still so lightweight and easy to hold.It's been a positive experience using it; I was hesitant to upgrade from a perfectly functional older Kindle, but am so glad I did for the above reasons.

    I had this e-ink reader in a sony model years ago.  I bought this for my wife to read in the sun and low light rooms, bedroom etc. The edgelight is excellent and the device smoothly joins the Wi-Fi an allowed her to access our existing Amazon library seamlessly.  I am extremely please with the reader and plan to buy one for myself as well.  This reader replaces a mac - ipad which is probably 3x as heavy and you cannot read the iPad at the beach. With this reader you can.  I recommend this over the base model due to the improved edge lighting which i find easy and eyepleasing .

    This is the best PaperWhite yet. Update
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The latest Kindle PaperWhite, is so much better than the previous PaperWhite. It is so much faster, the upgraded WiFi and screen are just wonderful. I have been using Kindle E-ink devices since I believe 2009. I have had the Kindle KB, the Voyage, and the Oasis 2, and a number of PaperWhites and Basic Kindles. This PW is the best of the group for me. The screen size is great, and it is so easy to see and read on. This PW is so much faster, and page turns are fast and smooth. Downloads almost happen instantaneously.  The updated LED lighting is even across the whole screen. I also received the cloth cover, in blue that matches the cover of my Fire HD 10 plus. When I got the Fire tablet I was expecting to never again get another Kindle E-ink device, but am I so glad that I talked myself into getting this PW. I didn‚Äôt get the special edition because I don‚Äôt need the 32 gigs, and the wireless charging. I am 74 years young and I read close to 100 books a year, most of them are Kindle Unlimited books.For the ones that have complained that this PW doesn‚Äôt do something, like playing games, and some of the other things I have read, let me say this the Kindles, PW, and the Oasis, etc, were all created to be ebook readers, nothing more nothing less. This PW does what it was intended to do so great.I believe that the developers decided to not include the Cellular capability because WiFi has become available almost everywhere, I find that I can find an WiFi HotSpot even where I cannot find Cellular signals.Now I am not someone that jailbreaks my devices even though I could in most cases. I am a retired IT Professional that has chosen to really retire and walk away from the job I use to do.  So I do not wish to were about devices drivers or any of that anymore.After well over a month of use this new Paper White Kindle, I have to say it is the very best Kindle that I have owned, and I have owned basic Kindles, KB, Voyage, and Oasis. This PW5 is fast and very comfortable to use with the Amazon Kindle cloth cover. I highly recommend it.

    Finally, a Kindle that does what I want; hope this review resolves some issues
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've owned several Kindles for various reasons and have found them lacking in speed and navigation. Also, I love to read in the bath. This Kindle resolves all those issues since it's waterproof and much improved. The extra space makes this much more readable. The pages flip as fast as on my Kindle Fire (which is heavier and unpleasant to hold). The lighting is very nice.But there are always bugs whenever something new is rolled out. Here are two I've seen here and tried to resolve on my own Kindle Paperwhite 2021.Software Update grayed out:  in my case, this was because my Kindle came with the latest software.No KindleUnlimited Free 4 Mos: Agreed. I registered my Kindle (actually, according to my account it was registered the day I ordered it). I did not receive a free 4-month Unlimited subscription. An hour of chat with customer support was to say the least frustrating. In the course of that, an email popped up with the free offer - about 18 hours after I registered the device.My only gripe is turning off those damned notes. I don't want to read other people's highlights. I had to Google that since turning them off is no longer available under Reading Options. (At least it wasn't on mine.)This is what you do. Open a book. Go to any page. Tap the top. Under the little house (Home) you'll see the font icon: Aa. Tap that on. A menu will pop up that says Themes Font Layout More. Tap on Moore. Scroll down. Right under ""About this Book"" you'll see Popular Highlights. Slide it off. Phew.Other than that, love this!

    Updated my review to 5 stars. I thought the size was going to bother me, but now I can‚Äôt imagine using the smaller screen! Also not sure why more people aren‚Äôt talking about the page turn animations! I love them!! I sold my previous generation, and now only use the 2021 model.Previous review: I upgraded from a 10th gen paperwhite. While I LOVE all the new features + USB-C charging, I wish they had just left the overall size of the Kindle the same. Instead they should have just made the bezels thinner on the sides and top of the original size. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd notice the small size increase, but it definitely makes it harder to hold even with a popsocket. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be replacing my 10th gen, but using the 10th gen on the go, and 11th gen at home.Remember Amazon, if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it, aka size of the Kindle!!

    UPDATE:Customer service was great helping me return the original flawed unit I received. Now, that I've spent quite a while using the replacement Kindle I've got (which is perfect now) I can honestly say again that it is the best Kindle I've had to date. The inclusion of the warm light alone is worth it. It allows for a more relaxed reading experience. The size of the screen is way better than the previous model. The weight feels balanced in my hands. Overall it feels like a great step forward. I used to feel the previous model was very cutting edge, but this new 2021 model makes it feel archaic. I hope Amazon continues to astonish with the models it has in store for the future. 100% recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is hands down the best Kindle I've owned out of four different versions. Unfortunately the screen arrived with a line (dead pixels maybe?) where light ""bleeds"" through. It is very distracting, specially when using dark mode. I tried to ignore it, but it definitively breaks the reading immersion.  I'm returning it and hoping I will get a perfect replacement. I will update this review with more details about the device and bump up the stars when this issue is resolved and can spend an honest time using the device.

    I had my last Kindle for 6 years and was honestly a little reluctant to upgrade because if it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶ But 6 years is a long time to hold on to tech, and I‚Äôm so glad I upgraded because this new version of the Paperwhite is amazing. I got so used to my trusty old Kindle being a little sluggish, I was pleasantly surprised at how seamlessly this version ‚Äúturns‚Äù the page. The bigger screen is so nice, and the ability to change the warmth of the backlight in addition to the brightness is spot on; when I‚Äôm reading in bed at night, a dim warm light is a nice option. The only con I‚Äôve found (and it‚Äôs really not a very big one) is the flush screen and the quick page refresh make it easy to accidentally change the page when I don‚Äôt mean to.

    I‚Äôve had a Kindle for a long time (15 years?) and love it. People give me paper books and I thank them but then I check it out from public library; I‚Äôd much rather read, let alone carry around, a Kindle. The paperwhite gives you the superpower of being able to read in the dark. This is my fourth one, the battery finally died in the last one, a gen7 paperwhite. This one is marginally better in several areas but not enough to make it worth an upgrade. If your paperwhite is working, don‚Äôt bother. If your old one isn‚Äôt working or isn‚Äôt a paperwhite buy it now you‚Äôll be glad you did. This new one is slightly larger and doesn‚Äôt fit in the back pocket of dress pants, just jeans.

I also love the USB-C charging.However,I‚Äôm starting to miss the ability to hold my kindle on one hand, especially at night as I read.I don‚Äôt like that the device had to be made bigger, when the last paperwhite‚Äôs size had more than enough space to include the same exact 6.8‚Äù screen.The weight is not that uncomfortable, but it starts to become noticeable if you read for a couple of hours back to back.Not only that, we still have the same sensitive and easily scratchable screen. I have already gotten a scratch on it, and I am not even sure if it came like that out of the box. Those tiny glowing white scratches are very distracting, especially when reading at night with the black setting.All in all, yes it is a great device, but it would be a lot more worth the money if those issues that have been around for years would finally be addressed.I have covered a more detail review in our youtube video in the account Duo.Armonia.

    This was a wonderful upgrade from my basic Kindle.  I'm glad I waited to get this new edition and didn't settle for the prior edition when the price dropped.As someone who reads 3+ hours a day (I don't watch TV unless it's an episode of Snapped or Top Chef) I will say that the battery life is great and it has been a breeze getting all of the books I've bought directly from authors on BookFunnel onto my new Paperwhite.

    A nearly ""Ideal"" eReader!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I got this as a gift for my father but set it up beforehand, so I got to test it out and see for myself how it renders out text. Wow! I have to say I was astounded as to how clear and sharp the text is. I and everyone in the family either has or have had a number of e-readers over the years, and this version is a major leap ahead. This is what I think everyone always was hoping for: real PRINT quality display technology!The backlight feature is handy of course and it's nice that they've added more granular steps from ""no light"" to fully lit. The size (of width and length) is essentially what you'd get for a standard paperback book and is very light weight (but not cheap feeling). Personally, I'd love to see a ""trade paperback"" sized version (something around 5"" x 8"") but this one is certainly more than adequate. I haven't been able to truly put the battery life to the test, but experience with other Kindle Paperwhite readers tells me that this one will perform just as advertised.My only wish would be to have the screen another half-inch higher, in order to have some of the controls always ""available"" instead of hidden. That's probably the one aspect of the interface that could be improved; certain settings or functions are not always very intuitive (and I've been using Kindles for years). Still, it's a relatively minor complaint because everything else about this device is amazing.

    In love. I purchased the 2018 kindle 2 months ago and found it so slow and the screen was small. I ended up purchasing the 2021 paperwhite during Black Friday and it‚Äôs such a vast improvement. It‚Äôs super fast, the screen is larger which makes it feel like it can capture an entire physical book page. I removed the ads which makes it more personal. And displayed my cover.  The warm light is great to balance with the brightness. Make sure to turn on screen refresh especially if you enjoy comics or manga. The size is a bit larger, which is hard to hold since I have small hands but I put a clear case, and a clear ring holder in the back and now it‚Äôs absolutely perfect. I have zero complaints. If you are second guessing yourself, don‚Äôt. Just get it üíû

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Two things. First off, I have been using the new Kindle Paperwhite 11 exclusively the last week or so and I have to say... They may have finally created the PERFECT eReader. Battery life is amazing, the screen looks amazing, the warm light feature is super nice but I tend not to use it because I get sleepyüòÇ, and the page turn animations are snazzy. I wasn't too sure about the size when it first came out because I was afraid it would be heavier, but it's truly not. I have RA and it doesn't hurt my wrist or fingers even after long sessions of holding it while reading. So yeah.... It's super close to being absolutely perfect. I don't really have anything negative at all to say about it at this point, besides I don't care for the flush screens (fingerprints galore) I liked bezels. That's all though.Second, this book is absolutely fabulous.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I am on my second Kindle Paperwhite 5 because I didn't like it the first time around. I didn't like it mainly because it was very slippery to hold and the margins are small. It was hard to keep a grip on it.However I decided to give it a second try and I just got a case with a strap on the back and a lap holder that can hold any device. I don't know what it is called but it was only $20 and I love it. I also have a sleeve for when I use just the case with the handle on the back. I love the case that has just the back part too. It makes a difference this time.The second Kindle I got also has no pinholes. That was another issue I had with the first one.I do miss having buttons but I do still have the Kobo Libra 2 for that fix. I have a hard time choosing between which device is better so I am keeping both still.The Paperwhite 5 is still better than the Kindle Oasis ever was to me. It has a better battery life, no ghosting issues and the battery doesn't drain. It's also easier to hold now that I have better accessories.It's a four star rating.

    At last!  A ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù Paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have owned every single kindle model since the first.  (OK maybe I have a problem, but there it is.) lately I would switch back and forth between the Oasis and the Paperwhite.  I loved the large, brighter screen of the Oasis, but the odd shape bugged me and I only used the buttons about 25% of the time.  I loved the size and shape of the Paperwhite but missed the larger screen and the big fat bezel bothered me.  Finally this is a kindle that, for me, combines the best features of both.  Great size, all the features of the Oasis, thin bezel and clear bright screen.  The battery life seems really good (I have been reading - about 2 to 3 hours a day - for a week and I am still at 66%.  This is IMO the best Kindle yet and I am more than pleased with it.Couple of little points‚Ä¶ It has not updated to the new UI but I am sure it will sooner or later.  Also I was unable to cancel the ads and get cover view (someone else mentioned this) but a call to customer service, who couldn‚Äôt figure it out but entered a ticket for it, put it right within 24 hours.After using it for a few days, one complaint. Yes the power button is STILL on the bottom so when using it propped up or on a stand the device will attempt to power itself off.  Very annoying and with all the updates to this device you would think that moving the button to the top would have been a no brainerJust adding another update:  Today is Nov 8th and I started using this on Oct 29th.  I have been reading around 2 or 3 hours a day (without turning on airplane mode for about half of that AND including downloading samples and books) and it is STILL at 44%.  So the battery life is probably the best I have experienced even including the older paperwhites.  I honestly think that we are heading to 2 week battery life here - something I have seen Amazon claim and have never experienced.Despite the power button placement, I can't find anything to complain about and highly recommend.

    Goodbye Oasis, I‚Äôll Only Miss Your Buttons (ad update)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    (Update, lowered one star)I‚Äôm disappointed that ads can‚Äôt be removed from this Paperwhite. I‚Äôve always preferred paying to clean up the interface on my Kindles. It took two days of customer service calls to finally clarify that this device doesn‚Äôt qualify for ad removal. That‚Äôs disappointing. Otherwise, my original review below stands(End update)I‚Äôve had and loved many Kindles since generation 2.6 inches is a little small nowadays, though, especially with big phones. I use the Kindle app on my iPhone Max a lot, and it‚Äôs nice and keeps the Kindle in the drawer most days, but I‚Äôm still much more likely to really get lost in a book and not get distracted with a Kindle. And besides the lack of distraction, e-ink screens are still uniquely pleasing to the eye and touch.I‚Äôve enjoyed my Oasis for a couple years now. I love the bigger screen and the page-turning buttons, but I don‚Äôt love that there‚Äôs almost no pocket in the world that can hold it.The new Paperwhite is a great screen size AND it fits in my pockets! I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt like the smaller bezels on it. I like big bezels. The giant bezel on the Oasis is just dreamy to me, but I‚Äôm finding that this Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in multiple ways without accidental screen touches, so I l‚Äôm happy they found an excellent balance between device size, screen size, and bezel size.The page turns are the zippiest I‚Äôve ever experienced on a Kindle.Being able to balance the two types of lighting is not essential to me, but I like it.Otherwise, if you know Kindles, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else new and exciting to report. I love it. Thanks, Amazon!

    My first kindle was the old school QWERTY keyboard. Then I moved on to the 2016 one. The battery for my first one was noticeably better, however, after so many years, it stopped working, hence the 2016 version. Now I‚Äôve moved onto the 2021 version and it was so worth it. Firstly, it just looks like a much more modern product. It‚Äôs faster, the screen is just as crisp (300ppi), and it uses a usb-c charger which will be a requirement going forward for all products in the European Union (so it‚Äôs also great for traveling - you just need an adaptor for the wall, not a converter as the charger holds 110-240V). The battery life is great as well (can‚Äôt remember vs my keyboard one, but better than 2016 one). This thing really is a beauty. It also chargers must faster than the prior version. From 15% to 100% in probably 3-4 hours. (I plugged it in when it was at 22% and it reached 58% in 40min for what it‚Äôs worth.)I‚Äôll be honest, my 2016 one worked just fine. I just wanted an upgrade this time. And the money back from mailing the old one back was a good push. 5 stars.

    I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite in May and was impressed with the ad that the battery life lasted longer than the previous model.  Well it doesn't.  I am constantly charging the Paperwhite and I do turn it off when not in use but doesn't seem to matter.  The biggest ""gripe"" that I have with this Kindle is that it is difficult (at least for me) to make the screen move.  I hold it tapping and tapping and using up the battery trying to find the home screen and the library.  I am following the directions but this home page just doesn't move and that is frustrating. I think 1 out of 50 may work as advertised and I got the 51 that doesn't!  I read the books on my computer waiting for the Kindle Paperwhite to charge when in the middle of a great story. Would appreciate any suggestions.

    Love it and definitely could love it even more
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    First of all let me state the obvious, this is an e-reader. This is not a tablet nor a mini laptop. If you‚Äôre interested in reading books and okay with reading magazines that aren‚Äôt in color (for the articles vs pictures), this device will help you do that in e-form.I started my Kindle journey with the very first Gen 1 and we have come a LONG way since then. Yes, there are certainly still minor things that can be improved upon however for all intents and purposes this is a wonderful device for what it‚Äôs meant to be used for.I have had zero issues with battery life. I am a binge reader in terms of off work days I read for hours and on work days I read for snatches of time here and there through my day and evening. I have charged the device from approx 5% to 100% maybe every week and a half or so. With the current charger it does take some time to get to a full charge so being able to upgrade to a lightening charger would be chef‚Äôs kiss. Alas since that is not yet an option I either allow my eyes the time off screen from reading to allow it to fully charge, charge overnight, or I switch over to my Kindle app on my cell while it‚Äôs charging.The ability to borrow ebooks from the library, purchase kindle editions of just about any book I would want directly from my Amazon account or use Kindle Unlimited offers a ton of options. If you sub to KU it more than pays for itself with just a book or two ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù. The price of Kindle books for purchase can vary. I have noticed that the YA and Adult fantasy/romance/dark academia genre I prefer can vary from maybe $7.00-ish on down (often even having temp markdowns to $0.99 here and there). Then there is the flip side, when I want non-fic or contemporary reads I have noticed they often stay upwards around the same price (or within a few dollars of) as a physical copy. In those instances I will often pass on buying and either wait for the library loan to be available or purchase the physical copy if it is one I want for my physical collection.The options for lighting (brightness/warmth) are lovely. I read in bed most nights and adjust the lighting so as not to disturb my husband but also so as not to strain my eyes or mess with my brains ability to know when it should sleep. The brightness gets very bright! And you can dim it fairly low while adjusting also the warmth to make it still comfortable to read but not causing sleep disturbances of other people in the same area.I have taken it on a few car trips and even on bright and sunny days it acts as paper just as advertised so there is no glare from the screen causing issues with being able to read, including when the sun is beaming directly upon the device.It is lightweight and for my hands east to hold. I love that it is waterproof so I can read in the tub without concern or even near a pool without worry of being splashed on.I am not sure yet on the selection of covers. I do recommend buying one with your device as it offers protection to your screen, although if you‚Äôre careful a nicely padded book sleeve would work well and probably offer so many more options for patterns, if that is your thing. I stuck with a basic blue Amazon cover. The device popped right in and stays secure. I have had to take it out only once since purchase and it was still easy to remove from the case despite being a secure cover. I cannot attest to if older gen of paperweight covers would also fit this, check dimensions of both to be sure unless you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt mind the chore of returning items later.As I stated previously in this review, I have had a few different generations of the first kindles as well as at least 2 generations of the Kindle Fire. Thus far I prefer the Paperwhite to a Fire because I am looking for an e-reader only. The tablet ability of a Fire is far too distracting even though I love that it‚Äôs in color. The color screen was the only thing I preferred.Now please do not get it wrong, there is room for improvement such as touchscreen response, adding color option, doing away with the ads without having to pay more when you‚Äôre already purchasing the device and thus will be purchasing or downloading borrowed books by way of library or KU. It would also be nice if the interface was more intuitive and not so ‚Äúclunky‚Äù when you‚Äôre moving around the library. Perhaps even options to have various ‚Äúshelves‚Äù similar to the Fire where my read books can be moved to a shelf and my TBR can be moved to another shelf (or however one would prefer to organize them).Another small issue is this is a waterproof device but when I have had a very small amount of water (like a literal drop or two) on the touchscreen it is not only not reactive but stays frozen for quite a bit of time. I have noticed that if I close the cover of hit the button to make it sleep and leave it for a few seconds it is fine when I awaken it and can once again swipe with no problem.I cannot yet attest if I would have preferred the 32gb in terms of if the 8gb being able to hold my ebook collection or not but that is something I am determining for future me. I do prefer the wireless charging capability of the 32gb and wonder why they don‚Äôt make the 8gb also wireless charging, especially in light of so many reviews complaining about not having usb-c or lighting ports.I also have my eyes on the Oasis, however that price really puts me off because I do still have a massive physical book collection that I am adding to all of the time. Perhaps one day if I decide to stop adding to that collection I could foresee the $299.00 price tag but for now having that side bevel and the external page buttons isn‚Äôt enough of an improvement for me to fork over that money. One day perhaps if I see some additional improvements based on the flaws pointed out by many reviewers so for now I stick with and absolutely love the Paperwhite.

    For the money, the newest Kindle Paper White is awesome. I've owned nearly all the Kindles since the first generations. I have an Oasis, and while the form factor is great overall... I prefer the Paper White. I don't like the buttons on the Oasis and the weight is offset switching from my left and right hands without rotating the device. The 2021 Paper White is symmetrical making it easier to switch between my hands without rotating the device and has a little better battery life.The screen on my Oasis is a little clearer though... probably because the glass is more transparent. The 2021 Paper White has a plastic screen... more susceptible to scratches, but less prone to breaking if dropped or carried around in a bag... pick your poison. I prefer the glass, but that's obviously not an option on the 2021 Paper White.My Oasis is a 1st Gen, and has a bluish backlight. I don't think it is worth he $250+ asking price to get the latest generation with a yellower backlight (the form factor is exactly the same). However, for the Price of the Paper White, it was worth it to me... I get the yellow/blue backlighting, better battery life, and the symmetrical form factor I enjoy.

    I purchased this for my wife as she needed a waterproof device for the spa/hot tub.  Frankly I have Kindle envy as the slightly larger screen and better letter definition really makes a nice difference.  Now that I‚Äôm not traveling as much the larger size is less of a detriment, though only some of my sport coat pockets are wide enough to support its size.  The extra $30 savings for Kindle Unlimited on top of the sale price made this an excellent value.  Overall an excellent purchase for someone who is newly retired from 50 years in nursing and is a prodigious reader.

    1. Physical Differences- 2021 charging port is USB-C vs microUSB my older 2017 .- 2021's screen is completely flush like a smartphone and the 2017 has bordered plastic housing.- 2021's Kindle front logo's font color on the bezel chin is dark gray and the 2017 is a black gloss color (think black car with black aftermarket rims. I actually liked this more than 2021).- 2021's dimensions are slightly bigger with thinner bezels for more reading and less page turning.- 2021's housing is surrounded by a more firm rubber Velcro feeling texture than the older model.2. Battery Life- 2021's screen has been on for about 15 minutes not and the battery has not dropped yet. Can't say the same about the older model since its a few years old.3. Software- 2021's more up-to-date CPU wins but its not night a day which may be due to e-ink technology. Don't expect some kind of M1 MacBook or AMD 5 series GUI (interface) responsiveness if this is your first e-ink device.- 2021 has dark mode and Bluetooth. These are new features for me and I'll figure out how to make best of the new tools.First impression thoughts: Minor upgrade overall but I knew that going in. I'm not a fan of the extra real estate but I'll learn to live with it. If you're a frequent traveler, I'd stick to the older models for easier travel storage (interior coat pocket to fanny packs). To me, personally, it isn't worth the 130.00+ retail especially only if you don't already have a previous gen. If you haven one yet then this year's model is worth it for the USB-C and better battery life- just wait on a good holiday deal. I got mine today with a price discount from last week plus additional discounts by trading in my 2017 for 20% off + 25.00 Amazon Credits.

    I have been a Kindle user since generation one.  I've loved them all for what they were but this Kindle finally made me say ""YES!  THANK YOU, AMAZON! THIS IS THE ONE!!""The screen is a little larger, it's waterproof, the touch screen works better than any of the other Kindles I've had and I can adjust my reading experience in more ways than ever now (brightness and fonts as I always could but now I can adjust the light warmth too)  I it charges quickly (finally a better charging cord).  I love it!!

    Coming from my Kindle Paperwhite 2013 (6th generation) this was a massive improvement. I love the larger screen, warm tint and dark mode, which is very important for nighttime reading. The screen resolution is great, with crisp, clear font, the screen lighting is uniform and the navigation is so much faster. Battery life seems great too, I‚Äôve been reading for five days and downloading books daily and the battery still has 60% left- with the WiFi turned on. I really have no complaints and expect to get many years out of this Kindle.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm upgrading from a previous Kindle Touch (4th Generation), so this is a great improvement with the in-screen light and other functionalities, however the touch screen is a bit glitchy and will sometimes freeze. Only way to get back to reading is a full restart with reload (see picture, typically reloading lasts a few minutes). Hope there is a software update soon. Otherwise the kindle feels great in hand and love that there is finally a USB-C charging port.Only thing holding me back from a 5-star rating is the software glitches. Constantly having to restart after a few setting changes or even sometimes randomly is incredibly disruptive and unfortunate. I want to love it, but not yet!Update: Received a new Kindle and it is working perfectly. Updating my review to 5 stars.

    I‚Äôm not sure why I waited as long as I have to buy a Kindle but I absolutely love it. Shipping did take much longer than I had expected but I‚Äôm also very impatient. I don‚Äôt have any prior models to compare it to but as an avid user of much larger tablet devices I will say the Kindle‚Äôs features make reading such a breeze! It‚Äôs lighter than my current cell phone and the adjustability of the screen and the many options you have for visibility is very accommodating. I have yet to read outside due to the current temperatures but I‚Äôm looking forward to hitting the hammock come spring and being able to read without a glare! Lastly, I wouldn‚Äôt say I have small hands, I guess average for a woman, but I did add a phone grip to the back and it has made a world of difference in holding the Kindle more comfortably. If you‚Äôve read this far, just buy it! You won‚Äôt regret it!

    This works great once you are reading.  At night if you want to turn the screen black you can change it to black to read.  I just keep learning as I go.  I think part of it is I bought a horrible book to read first.  It makes me not want to read at all.  I have to get another book.  Practice with that book.  I do like the kindles battery life.  I have only charged it once in I guess a month.  I think that is pretty cool.  My other kindles were very needy and the battery was crying to be charged.  I hope this last a long time.

    I was debating upgrading to this kindle from my 2017 paperwhite and I‚Äôm glad that I did! I love the larger screen and that the screen is flush and not in-set in the devices, so no more dog hair gets stuck in it. The warm light setting is a game changer for reading before bedtime if you have sensitive eyes like me. My only complaint is that the screen acquires smudges fairly easily. Not a big deal but I catch myself getting distracted by them when I‚Äôm reading. I paired my kindle with the lavender haze case which is cute and comfortable. I recommend upgrading if you‚Äôre on the fence like I was. This device fixed every complaint I had about my previous 2017 model.

    I bought the generation 11 to replace my 3rd generation. I had my eye on this for a while when it went on sale during the recent prime day. Couldn't resist.This is obviously much improved over my old one. I was a little disappointed that the text doesn't seem as black as the 3rd generation. After adjusting text settings it's more comfortable for me. I love the lighted display, there are a lot of settings to get it to how you like it. I'm still playing with it, it's way different than my old one but in a good way. I'm not very tech savvy but find navigating settings is pretty straight forward.Can definitely recommend if you have an older version and want to upgrade, I'm very happy with it.

    I'm very pleased with my purchase. I've debated for years on whether or not to get an e-reader at all. I made the decision to try to spend less on books and I believe that having this Kindle will help me do that. I have not seen a 10-week-long battery life just yet but it does last quite long. I've charged it once since I received it Dec. 3. I really enjoy all the features this new Paperwhite comes with especially the USB-C and the adjustable warmth light. I decided on just getting a skin instead of a cover and I'm happy with that. It's a little wide for my tiny hands but it works just perfect. üòã I enjoy the reading experience on this device more than I ever did on a tablet or my phone. Besides my red dragon plush that my mother got me this is my favorite Christmas present.Cons: I don't like that the power button is on the bottom. When I put it on a stand it cuts on and off. I don't know why they didn't put the power button on the side or the top. Hopefully they will move the power button to a more convenient spot in future versions.

    My favorite device for outdoor reading
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This new Kindle Paperwhite 2021 is the latest in this line of eReaders, with a few key upgrades over previous versions.  As an avid reader of Ebooks, I am always looking for the most comfortable devices to read on, so I was very excited to try out this newest model.  Here are my thoughts so far:Notable upgrades from previous version:--6.8‚Äù Display:  previous version was 6‚Äù--USB-C charging: previously was micro-USB.  Also now 10 weeks of battery life with 2.5 hour charge--Faster:  quoted as 20% faster page loading--Brighter:  10% brighter at max brightness, also can adjust ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù setting of screen to your preference.So far, I have enjoyed the larger screen, and this Paperwhite looks nice and bright even on sunny days outside.  I obviously appreciate the long-overdue upgrade to USB-C charging, and so far the battery life seems great.  I can notice a slight speed difference, I'm not sure if I would've said that it feels like it is 20% faster though.  The ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù setting bar can shift the color from more of a bluish to a more yellowish tone, on a slider bar.  I'll have to test it out more, but so far my eyes seem to prefer reading with the brighter bluish tone.Overall, the biggest deal for me is having a nice sized screen that is easy to read even in the brightest environments.  The waterproof IPX8 rating is nice too, as it makes me feel more comfortable reading outside without worrying about getting it wet.  For outdoor reading, nothing really compares to this Kindle Paperwhite and the more expensive Kindle Oasis, as since this is less expensive than the Oasis, it is now my favorite reading device.  I look forward to hours of reading outside on this nice bright screen, and I will update this review if I notice any other important details over time.

    I waited a long time to buy my first Kindle. I have been reading on my iPhone and iPad for a long time, and now I can save the batteries on those things!This is lightweight and a great size, and I love using it. Winter is here, so I probably won‚Äôt take this outside to read much, but I already find the anti-glare to be beneficial with the various light sources around me. Setup was easy, and how-to resources are easily accessible right inside the device‚Äôs settings.After about 6 weeks I started to notice that the bottom corners have been getting loose, and I don‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs like the screen is separating from the back of the device by a small margin and I have to pinch the corners to put them back in place. It worries me that this is happening so soon after buying. I have really enjoyed my experience, otherwise.

    Okay so it‚Äôs only been a few weeks and it works great I haven‚Äôt needed to charge often. I got to sync the kindle app on my phone with my kindle and it works great. I keep reading anywhere and don‚Äôt lose my place in a book. That being said I found it more enjoyable because I had kindle unlimited. Which is good for testing out books before buying the physical hardcover or paperbacks. I haven‚Äôt changed the lighting because the current setting doesn‚Äôt bother me. Now like any product extras come separately. You need to buy the wall outlet separately, the case and the screen protectors just like you would for any computer or phone. I like the size of it. And it‚Äôs not heavy, very light weight. The touch screen is okay, its not anything fancy but I don‚Äôt hate it. So far so good, I‚Äôm hoping they do a color one in the future but that‚Äôs simply for aesthetic reasons rather than anything else. Price wise I would say you get what you pay for. I got it on sale for Black Friday and doing monthly payments, my first time trying out that feature. Compared to a nook, which costs about maybe thirty dollars less and other than a color screen does not offer an unlimited reading plan so you have to buy the books or get only the  free books which aren‚Äôt usually by very well known authors. Since I have both, I will say I‚Äôve used my kindle more in the first three weeks than my nook. Definitely worth a try.

    This is my third or fourth Paperwhite. It's bigger, faster and lighter than the previous generations. Pages turn faster. Well, everything is faster. The user interface is a little clunky and there's an annoying learning curve. Not that well thought out, IMO, but it's still worth the trouble. Amazon dropped the ball on the cases to protect it so you may wish to look around for something that doesn't require you to auction off your first born child to pay for a case that is just not up to par.

    I had an old Paperwhite (white one) and I didn‚Äôt like it very much.But I wanted to give it a try again and get the newest Paperwhite, and I‚Äôm very happy with my decision.It‚Äôs waaaaaay getting better and I always have a great reading experience with it.It‚Äôs little too big for my hand but I use a popsocket.Also I could connect to my Japanese Amazon account very easily. So do not hesitate to get it if you live in US but wanna read books with your language.

    Page turning is fast; small bezels make reading faster too, since there is less page turning.  This also has the option for warm light and page-turn animation.

    I have had Kindles in the past and then I transitioned over to a Fire tablet for a bit... I hated reading on it, there were too many ads and the battery life was bad. This kindle is great! The battery life is amazing, it is light weight and so easy to read on. I am loving it so much and the Paperwhite is so easy on the eyes. Would recommend to any reader.

    Better Reading Than Kindle Oasis
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I like my Kindle Oasis 2019 but it doesn't hold a charge.  When I read a lot in a day I am apt to have to recharge twice and, on normal days, recharge every day.  So I thought I'd give the Paperwhite 2021 a whirl.  I didn't expect the Paperwhite to be this good, but it is.  I LOVE it!  One, it is slight, iighter, easier to hold, less clunky.  I don't go anywhere without my Kindle.  The Paperwhite 2021 is easier to cart around.  Two, who needs those Oasis page-turner buttons when a quick and slight tap on the screen does the job?  Three, the display is larger than the earlier Paperwhites.  Though not as large as the Oasis, its almost as large and, in my opinion, quite perfect and better than earlier Paperwhites.  Four, the adjustable warm light is very nice.  The newest 2021 Oasis also has this feature but.....the price for the new Paperwhite is lower.  Now, I'm not sure how long a charge will last because it arrived just yesterday.  I'll update my review when I figure that out.  (I do use Airplane mode to protect the charge).  In sum, with the Paperwhite 2021 I found my perfect Kindle and prefer it to the Oasis.

    Would have given 5 stars but the side bezels are too narrow to hold comfortably, and the power button should be at the top. I keep accidentally turning the page and turning off the power while reading. Hoping these small issues go away when the case I ordered arrives and is installed. The text is sharp and response is fast. The 4 months of free Kindle Unlimited is generous.

All my books automatically showed up instantly on my new Paperwhite without any problems at all. I don't know how or why some reviewers seem to have problems setting theirs up. Maybe they just can't deal with simple technology. Anyway I highly recommend this new 2021 Kindle Paperwhite it's awesome.

Dark mode is the best!Here's a list of my pros and cons.Pros:- perfect size for holding for long periods- can read for extended periods of time without hurting my eyes- the battery just keeps going and going- Amazon offers tons of great case optionsCons:- the navigation and the user interface is a little confusingFor anybody who loves reading I would definitely suggest picking up a Kindle it's takes up almost no space and you don't have to have clutter with tons of books or worry about your books being ruined. I missed reading and ever since I got my Kindle I read every other day at least and don't look at my phone so much!

    I like that it's light weight comfortable to hold.  All my books are in one place, and it has a long battery charge for reading ebooks,  uses up power playing audiobooks.  Using a Kindle reader there are no distractions just reading or listening to a book.  No multitasking on tablet, phone or computers.Vouce View Screen Reader function is challenging.  To use after pair your head phones and before turning on VVS, open your library and select the Kindle book you want to read. Open the section you want to read.  Then pull down menu, go to Settings and select Assessibility.  Select VVS and turn on.  Return to back to listen to it read aloud as text to speech use to do.

    If you're like me, you are getting pretty tired of looking at the stack of books that are spilling onto the floor. My husband bought me a Kindle and I wasn't thrilled. I love the feeling of a real book in my hands, so I thought Id hate this. I was so wrong. This holds, reads, and feels like a book (with the foldable cover- sold separately) I love to read in bed at night, and my traditional book light is so bright and likely contributes to my insomnia. The Kindle has both a day and night feature with controlled brightness. It has a warm and subtle backlight. With Kindle Unlimited, I've been able to transfer several of my traditional bound books to my Kindle for $9 per month.

    I love this device. I've always wanted a bigger screen for my e-reader and this new paperwhite has just that. I updated from my 2nd generation paperwhite so I love that this one has a flushed screen. I haven't reached 0% on the battery so I don't know how long it lasts but I've read positive reviews saying that it's insanely long so I'm looking forward to it. The page turning is noticeably faster and the warmth adjustment is really nice too. I love that I can save my favorite font, font size, text spacing as a ""theme"". I read in both English and Vietnamese and the text in Vietnamese is always tighter so having this theme option is really convenient since I don't have to readjust the font or spacing every time. Overall I really love this device and would recommend it for anyone who wants to update from the 3rd or previous generations of paperwhite or from a normal kindle. If you currently have the 4th generation I don't think it's worth the update since it's quite expensive.

    Fast, Nice Screen Size, Really Like it
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update:I'm very happy with the Paperwhite.Amazon sent new unit, and it automatically updated to new software shortly after I set it up.As stated previously, it's very fast, I like the screen size, it's easy on the eyes, lightweight & easy to hold, and I'm glad they changed to the USB-C connection so I can use the same wire that I use for my phone. I've been reading more than I had in a long time now that I have it.Update:After reading all reviews, it's obvious that I received a Paperwhite with old software, as a number of other people did as well. My device info shows Firmware Version 5.14.0.1, but from reviews I've read outside of Amazon, I believe the new version is 5.14.1.  I contacted customer service, and they are sending a replacement, which the agent said ""should"" have the new software on it. Let's hope that those of us who are getting replacements do receive units with the correct updated software.I've decided that I do like it much more for reading than my Kindle 8 in spite of the old software.I will update my review again after receiving the new one.---------------Previous Review:Kind of disappointed. I've loved all of my Kindles, and really wanted to love my first Paperwhite.First the good:The screen size is nice.The screen is easy on the eyes.It's light weight for comfortable holding.The USB-C is great - no more searching for the right wire.It's fast.Now the not so good:UI does not look like what is shown on Amazon's Paperwhite 2021 product page. Their photo shows the ability to swipe down on the top of the screen to access the menu, but mine has a top menu that doesn't go away on the Home screen.  No up or down swiping inside a book either - you need to tap the upper part of the screen to access the menu. You can only swipe left or right to turn pages.  And if you accidentally touch the screen anywhere other than the top when reading, it will go to the next page, which is infinitely annoying.Also, Amazon's photo shows navigation at the bottom of the screen to switch between Home, Library or the book you are reading, but mine has no such feature. That is something I would have liked to make navigation more convenient.The Paperwhite doesn't seem to have page turn animation, or at least I can't find the setting for it, and neither could an Amazon rep who spent almost an hour on the phone with me regarding my issues.  I realize this is my own personal preference and may not matter to other people, but it makes a difference to me. That's one thing I loved about reading on my Fire 8 - it gives the sense of reading a real book, but the Fire 8 is too slow even after cleanup and reboot, and takes forever to load a book. It's also a bit too heavy to hold for long periods of time. Although Amazon does not actually mention page turn animation in their description, according to two reviewers on Amazon, and also two independent reviews elsewhere, they do have animated page turn on their new 2021 Paperwhites. So I'd like to know how I can enable it on mine.Two buyers commented in their reviews that they received units with old software but couldn't update to the latest version as the update option is greyed out. It's greyed out on mine as well, which I initially assumed meant that I already have the latest software, but now I'm wondering whether that may be the issue with mine. Maybe I really don't have the latest version of the software, but I can't update it.I really had high hopes for the Paperwhite, but as of now I'm on the fence as to whether I'll keep it or go back to using my Fire 8 for reading. If I can get these things resolved, I'll happily come back to add stars and update my review.

It was not immersed like to hype says it can.It‚Äôs been 2 days now and I still get a long message on the screen that the device detected moisture when I try to charge it.  The message says to put it upwards to dry it out and then it will charge.  How long do I have to wait?  I am very disappointed since the water resistant feature is very important to me?  If I ever get it dry and charged I will be placing it in a waterproof sealed case.

The Kindle is great for travel, so you don't have to dedicate luggage space to multiple books, but also great for just keeping with you or having around the house. It's so lightweight and thin. I added a popsocket to the back of mine to make it even more comfortable to hold. I recommend for any avid reader!

    I gave this Paperwhite 5*s because so far I like it!!!!  I have had several kindle‚Äôs, my last Paperwhite being a 7th generation.  I was completely satisfied with my 7th generation but wanted something newer so I ordered the new 11th generation Paperwhite. Glad I did.I have to say that the viewing area does seem to be the perfect size. The lighting is soothing or more book like or less harsh, etc. Can't really put my finger on it other than to say reading seems effortless. I have been checking the 11 against my 7 side by side and it's a huge improvement.  I like it.I have not experienced fuzziness or any of the other reviewers  issues but have only had my 11 for a few days.The waterproofing and ability to listen to audio via blue tooth are not high on my list of e-reader priorities but they're nice to have.The software upgrades are a huge improvement.  But of course they are also available on my 7 for the most part. The 11 screen does seem to be more responsive than on my 7 despite it having the same software updates.I am happy I made the move to the 11 and you will be too. Try it you'll like it!!BTW I did not buy the kindle cover but I did buy another vendor‚Äôs cover. I highly recommend buying a cover for your device. I do not enjoy reading on my kindle without a cover it makes it feel more book like to me but that's really just personal preference.  If you buy a cover make sure it's for the 11th generation as covers  for earlier generations will *not* fit.All in all I üíï  my new 11th generation Kindle Paperwhite and you will too.

Definitely recommend those who have much older models to upgrade or if you‚Äôre new to kindle. It feels great to be able to read in the dark and have touch screen. Overall very happy with my purchase, no complaints.

    My husband bought me the ad free version and the extra $20 spend was a waste... this thing is full of ads/recommendations.  Don't waste your money to remove ads because it's a joke.Also,  I literally just got this thing and today it's on Black Friday sale for $35 less than I just paid.Besides those minor frustration,  the new paperwhite is a nice upgrade from my previous Kindle Voyager.

    Crisp brilliant display, long battery life and a very comfortable holding weight. Amazon doesn‚Äôt mess around with it‚Äôs kindles. They are designed to be the best, and to give you the best user experience. Amazon happens to hit the mark on all of those things. Not only that, but I‚Äôm really enjoying having the warm light implanted into the new era of kindles. As you can see from my picture hopefully, the text is amazingly crisp and sharp. Page turns are nice and quick‚Ä¶. And battery life is really outstanding. I would highly  recommend this unit to everyone. Oh, and having the USB-C charging port is also a welcome feature over the old kindles. Can‚Äôt go wrong with purchasing one.

    I was giving this for mother's day!  I love ‚ù§ it.  I like that I can set the level of whiteness of the screen,  I get migraines and bright white gives me a headache.  I have the brightness on auto, but I can turn it down.  I get blurred vision from back lit screens,  the kindle is better.  I can still have blurry vision when I use it for a few hours but the strain is much less pronounced.  It's light weight and easy to use.  The only issue I  have is getting back to the home screen,  the kindle keeps opening the books information, so it takes mea few tries to get it right.

    I guess I just expect more.  I had to edit this review after looking at my ""Goodreads"" account.  Goodreads tracks the books that you've read on your Kindle.  Since March of 2020 I have read 290 books.  Accept for professional ""reviewers"" or editors I guess that's an awful lot more than the average person has read.And, while that doesn't seem overdone to me I imagine it would to many.  However, the fact remains, the battery life is not nearly as long as Amazon would have you believe, 10 weeks, that is such a wrong statement, unless you only read for 15 - 30 minutes a day, then perhaps it will last that long though I doubt it.  If you're an avid reader be prepared to plug it in at least every other day.  The response time, for page turning, or anything is slow.  The last 2 updates are trash and make the Kindle Table of Contents even slower, The Table of Contents is bulky and unwieldy.  Seriously, it's easier and better to look at book covers as opposed to just the title???  As for a color Kindle - again, seriously are your books in color?  Why does the Kindle need something else to go wrong?  Intuitive - no way are these updates intuitive, response time is slowed to unbelievable levels.  I've lost track of how many times I've had to restart my Kindle, It's a year and a half old.  Yes, I do read a lot, between 2 - 3 hours per day.  My kindle has to be charged every 3 - 4 days at the most.  There used to be a Kindle ""forum"".  Doesn't exist any longer - too many complaints I believe.  Now you will get no response from Amazon (except lip service - - - maybe) no matter what your comment.  I use a Kindle because I ""need"" to read, I have issues with my hands and can not hold a hardcover book - - hence I 'm sorry to say I depend on the Kindle.  In one of the reviews, the reviewer had some similar complaints.  The reviewer also said he received a ""call"" from the developer??!? Not sure how that happened since on the site there there no Tel # nor was there a reply from any developer, nevertheless I had hoped that was a true statement and that changes would come about deleting the horror of the last 2 updates.  That hasn't happened -

No need to turn off and on. Open the cover and you are on the page where you closed it. Close the cover and it is turned off. It is waterproof so you can read it at the beach or in the bathtub.

    I never intended on buying another Kindle.  Along came Prime Day.  I grabbed this for about 100 bucks.In terms of the need of wireless charging for this?  You have to be kidding.  The battery life is go good on this (I read a novel and used 12 percent of battery) that connecting it once every 4-6 weeks is hardly an inconvenience.  I am thrilled without this option.I'd like to offer a comparison between this Paperwhite and the Kobo Sage.  There is not a better engineered EReader for holding in the hand than that one.  It's expensive.  Where the Kindle wins is clearly in battery life.  Kobo wins with the user experience,  however it's battery life is disappointing and in line with the 1st EReaders introduced.  But unless you are on a lengthy period away from charging - this is a non issue.The best bang for the buck??  Paperwhite.  If you have never owned one, or want to upgrade?  You will not be disappointed.If money is no object, the Kobo Sage is the premier EReader right now.  Despite its shortcomings, it's difficult to forget its ease in library borrowing,  as well as the amazing feel in hand.  Amazon still has not gotten that quite right.  Not by comparison.

    I love, love, love my KIndle.  And I love this Paperwhite. Not only can I take my entire library with me and only carry the single device, but I can program it so that reading is like picking up the hard over or paperback -- a creamy colored background with black type -- and adjust more than just backgrounds and type. A battery that lasts 12 hours or more gives me ample time to read a book before I need to recharge. A brilliant piece of technology and mine is no exception. I love it. I still love my hard covers and paperbacks but having this with me is easy and convenient.  I love my Kindle!!

    Huge upgrade. Still a few small issues.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the previous generation Paperwhite which I have loved and used a lot. I'd imagine that I average about 1-2 hours of reading per day. The battery life in my 2019 Paperwhite was really dwindling. In fact, if I was reading with the wifi on, I would not expect more than 12 hours of battery life.  It had been a great device that would occasionally need to reboot for no apparent reason, but it was time to replace it.So far, I am thrilled.It is so much more responsive to touch than the last version. I hated typing anything on my kindle and only did when I needed to search for a book in the kindle store. Typing had been so slow and laggy, and often a letter would not be recognized.This is no longer as big of a problem. It obviously is more sensitive to input by typing, and highlighting is far quicker and more accurate.Page turning is so quick, at times I am wondering if the page even turned. Because of this, Kindle has implemented a page turning animation that actually helps you see the page turn. At first, I thought the page turn animation would just be a gimmick, but it actually is necessary because of how responsive the page turn feature is.Being a bit larger screen, it is helpful that I can widen the margins to keep a similar width for quicker and easier reading.My only complaint is that the bezel is becoming so small, you feel like you need to hold the edge more carefully. This took a little getting used to and then I didn't need to think about it. A suggestion that I'd make to Amazon is to incorporate a setting that would allow the reader to modify how much of the screen is touch sensitive so that you can widen the margins and touch the page without turning to the next page. Another thought is that Amazon might want to develop an ergonomic cushioned attachment that makes gripping the device a little more comfortable.It definitely feels like a good upgrade over the last model. Even the battery seems to have a higher capactiy. I read yesterday with the wifi on for over 3 hours and was still at 95% battery. It's somewhat misleading when Amazon claims that the battery lasts for weeks. I use a kindle pretty much daily, and I like to have the wifi on so that it sinks up with my audible library. I was usually charging my last paperwhite 2x per week. I'll be interested to see how this compares after a little bit of time. Moving to USB-C is very appealing. I'll be glad to be 100% done with micro USB, not to mention the faster charging times will be very welcome.Overall, I'm very happy with the new device. All of the upgrades seems useful and not at all gimmicky. It's a lot more device for about the same amount of money.

    Amazon has hidden this top review.
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Reduced to one star for review manipulation by Amazon. No reason given. Garbage reviews now dominate the top slot. This is a comprehensive and thorough review, which had the top spot for months on end. And then they just decided to hide it for no reason at all.This was the top review, and it's easily the most comprehensive, but Amazon apparently has hidden it away from people now. Oh well I guess.Summary:+ Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date+ Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle+ UI improvements+ Weight and feel are exceptional- Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness- Flipping through Library is still abysmal when large- Previous Kindles still do things in much the same wayComing from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it's a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It's never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it's worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it's not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I'll say this issue really doesn't affect me much.Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still  has a fully stable lighting array that doesn't evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it's not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won't even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.For memory and storage, I can't see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone's lifetime.As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they've had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this Kindle. The ONE MAJOR caveat, just like your Cart items for the regular Amazon site, is that Library is becoming absolutely obscene to sift through. It's not something that is okay anymore. They need a major list overhaul feature for people with hundreds of books. Amazon UI designers still have a lot of issues they need to fix, but since this applies to all Kindles, it doesn't have much to do with this particular device.Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don't really like the Oasis 3, but it's definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can't stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it's mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.Battery life seems improved. I wouldn't call it all that great on full brightness, but it's definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, yet I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It's tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This obviously produces a charge that lasts a very long time. With hibernation, I have no issues with battery life, but it's only a few months old.Stemming from that thought, I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren't going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn't really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It's a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle.The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don't think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It's a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option.Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for anybody in the market. Will it replace my physical collection? Never.

    Update, They just updated my new Kindle so that it no longer works well at allDid away with pages and went to a screen of unknowable length with no way to navigate.The scroll bar is a joke with no control, so you must move one item at a time.Why do the software people hate them now?Called for support again.  She was much better than the last but after over 20 minutes experimenting, the nice lady said the system had changed so much that the old options are no longer available.  All she could do was return the setup to where it was marginally working and not user friendly.She claimed Amazon monitored and cared, but their actions indicate otherwise.The original Kindles were so great.Why do the software people hate them now?We are so frustrated that we cannot categorize and find the books that are on the kindle.When I sought help, they told me I had to search on my PC or phone, but that doesn't help find what's on the kindle. When I said that was r*diculous, they said they didn't like that word.Go back to pages rather than one screen you cannot scroll through.Consider going to another device if you want usability.Does Nook do better?

    I've had a Paperwhite for over 8 years and have never felt any need to upgrade.  However, the Prime Days deal on this latest model was so good that I couldn't pass it up. The new features are worth it to me -- slightly larger screen that actually makes a big difference, more robust library management software, and an adjustable amber light setting that is more enjoyable than I anticipated. Plus the battery life is pretty astounding.  I've only charged it once so far since purchasing it.

    Love the non glare screen and back light that you can dim in the evenings and take out the blue light spectrum so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with sleep. Sure beats having to put a clip light on it.

    My first lasted a very long time.  I think about ten years.  I took it everywhere.  So very convenient.  When the inevitable day came when it stopped holding a charge, I replaced it immediately.  It is so easy to read.  The battery holds a charge for a very long time and it is simple to navigate.

    I‚Äôve only had it a few days, but so far it‚Äôs great. It is much more comfortable reading on this kindle rather than the Fire Tablet.  The size is great and feels comfortable while holding. It just seems like you can‚Äôt remove audible titles from the device without going through somewhere else and permanently deleting them. I want them, I just don‚Äôt want to see them on this device. Also, I wish you could read and listen to books at the same time.  Connecting to the internet is a nice feature, but not good enough to use frequently.Space does not seem like it will be an issue unless you plan on buying thousands of books or having hundreds of audible books on there at the same time.I would recommend this to any reader or someone who needs a kick in the pants to read more. You can even connect to the library and send books to your kindle for free.  Get the ad free version. In the long run, I think you‚Äôll be happy with that decision.

    8 Month Review
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After 8 months of consistent use, I'm finally ready to review this device from the perspective of a post-graduate/student studying for certifications.I'm a somewhat recent college graduate who, before, hadn't read a book since high school and was just as unwilling to go out of my way to buy a book I likely would start to read and forget about halfway through. That said, prior to trying the Kindle out, I was just as unwilling to switch to an e-reader - adamant in my own head that I can't stand reading on anything other than paper. With that out of the way, here's my review.Pros:- The e-paper display, though purely monochromatic, allows for very easy reading that honestly doesn't differ much from printed text.- Due to the type of display used, battery life is almost a non-factor. The 'screensaver' will distract you from that and I admit, it took me a while to get over. If it's that big of an issue, you can always get a case with a front cover (the Kindle will lock automatically when 'closed')- Selection of books on Kindle Unlimited are vast and many. Furthermore, importing other documents or e-books downloaded on your PC is as easy as emailing said files to your Kindle - though the instructions to do so could've been a little clearer. My free time has been taken over as such from reading novelizations of my favorite manga.- If you're a student with a lot of required reading or a need for supplementary material of any kind, I think you'll find the Kindle to save you both time and money (most importantly).Cons:- Aforementioned e-paper display will turn off people who aren't as familiar with the tech. It's nothing comparable to the newer LED/OLED/MiniLED displays on your phones or tablets; it's meant to run minimal power for its function, a feature I came to appreciate but came with some patience as well.- Something I hadn't noticed until using for some time is, though I can always 'zoom' to increase/decrease text size, that I wouldn't have minded going for a larger display - strictly for comfort.- I hate how the 'lock' button is on the bottom. I usually use my pinky for my book to perch on while I read but trying to do so here left me fiddling with a locked Kindle more times than I'd like to count. I countered this by getting a case with a strap on the back by which I can hold the device, but after a while, it didn't take long for me to get over it and avoid that spot entirely.Ultimately, I wish I had purchased this device during college. From a student's perspective, it's invaluable considering the costs of textbooks. Even now, as I pivot from my degree to a totally new field of study, there are countless books on Kindle Unlimited I can use for reference. From deep philosophical thought experiments by Einzelganger to RPi4 and Arduino projects, the Kindle is something you may not use everyday but you'll be very glad you bought one whenever the need should arise.

    First impressions, should you buy one, and how to save money
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    OK, I fouled up with my Kindle Paperwhite 11th edition purchase. It was Prime Day and the Kindle was marked WAY DOWN, and I opted for the bundle: Kindle + Charger + fabric cover. Now don't get me wrong, the Charger is nice and the fabric cover is very nice, but for a device Amazon says you only need to charge 5 times a year, getting a premium charger doesn't really make much sense. I already have plenty of chargers, and the Kindle will charge overnight whether I use their super-fast premium charger or something else. And while the case is undeniably nice, you can get one for less than half the money from other sellers on Amazon.I did not make the mistake of getting the ad-free version. The ad appears on the lock screen and as soon as you swipe the screen, it goes away and stays away for your entire reading session. It's 100% unobtrusive. Other people have given the Kindle one star because they bought the ad-free version, and were angry there are still ""suggestions"" on the Home screen that they  consider ads. All I can say is that you get that no matter what, and the solution is to switch to the Library screen rather than the Home screen; that's very easy on the latest software version.The other huge mistake I made over 4 years ago was subscribing to Kindle Unlimited and somehow not knowing that it was automatically renewing silently every month (for $9.99). I paid enough to buy several Kindles. I guess I thought it was part of Amazon Prime or just something that comes with a Kindle. You can bundle Kindle Unlimited ""Free"" for 3 months with your Kindle purchase, but just watch out when that 3 months are over. I have generally found Kindle Unlimited books second rate (with a few exceptions).I bought one of the original Kindle Fire versions and the first Kindle Fire HD. They were cool, but I didn't end up using them much. They didn't have good battery life, they were hard to read outdoors, and Kindle software on other portable devices was fine. I think the first one eventually failed, and I gave the HD away to someone who needed to do something that required a Kindle. I have a nice Windows tablet.But I have always wanted a Paperwhite because of its long battery life and superb readability outdoors. Plus it was heavily discounted on Prime Day and I bought one.So how did it live up to expectations? Pretty well. The ""10 weeks"" battery life claim seems exaggerated, but still if you pick it up to go somewhere, it will probably be charged and last another day. Outdoor readability is simply amazing.After receiving the device, the software updated. I think it updated twice. My ""Experimental Web Browser"" turned into the ""Web Browser"" and the navigation improved markedly (addressing issues I read in other 1-star reviews). The web browser is still very limited and doesn't display some web pages correctly (like the Internet  Archive), and error messages still mention the ""Experimental"" browser. You can't access YouTube, for example, Twitter doesn't seem to work at all, and the New York Times is not readable.On books, three-level table of contents don't work on the Kindle, although they work on Kindle for PC.I had a very good experience emailing a PDF document downloaded from our local Planning Commission to the Kindle. Things you send to the Kindle arrive very fast. Amazon did, however, require me to verify myself as a sender before it would deliver email attachments to the Kindle, even though my email address is on the approved senders list at Amazon. Also plugging the Kindle to a PC lets you drag and drop supported document types (notably MOBI and PDF) to the Kindle where the immediately appear in your Library. The Send to Kindle for PC app is currently broken as reported by me and others on Amazon forums.The device is somewhat sluggish in general with a 1-second delay for most things: swipes, scrolls and navigation. That's certainly not something that would interfere with reading a book. There are so many different ways to navigate, that it can appear jumbled and confusing, plus the software updates I got changed everything, making me re-learn the UI. I think in the end that I will be accustomed to it and it will appear more natural.One severe limitation is that you cannot play audio files in general. While it supports Bluetooth headphones for books from Audible, it cannot play music or audio books in general. (I hope this is enhanced in a future software update.)So should you buy one of these? If you want to sit outdoors under a tree or at the beach for hours on end reading a book, a Kindle Paperwhite makes a lot of sense. The reading experience is good, it's visually sharp and the charge lasts a long time. If you want to listen to music, or do much of anything else you can do on a phone or a tablet computer, you're out of luck.

    a lot nicer than 7th gen...but a bug exists
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    PROS: Well, I REALLY like the 11th Gen over my 7th Gen.  I'll do it in 4 points:1-Larger Screen.. Nice2-Color Temp adjustment for the screen.  My background is photography so to me the new screen goes from say 8000 degrees Kelvin to about 2500 degrees Kelvin.  I'm happy around 4700-50003-LONGER battery life.. like 2 months vs 3 weeks4- USB-C!! YES! (my old microUSB was always getting wobbly.I did not mention the increase from ""4""GB to ""8""GB..because ..well. in the 7th Gen  the 4GB  is actually 3.1GB  with the rest taken up by the OS  on the new one.. it's actually...wait for it.. 6.25GB! Yep  the OS went from .9GB to 1.75GB!  A bit piggy for me.  I made a joke with a few of the Kindle Tech people that they got ideas from Windows Vista!.  Most got the joke.CONS: Now  onto issues..several which are really for how I use my Kindle:1- ok  the not quite 8GB issue.  Hey  I understand the increase in size..but how about making Audible a CHOICE.. you can add it or make it optional.  If you take away Bluetooth support and Audible..maybe we might gain some space back.  (Personally I use nice plug-in headphones.  I really only see Audible BT when on a long drive in the car..like music.  But then again, you can just put it in a format like MP3 and play it thru the car.  I have the entire Hitchhiker's Guide Radio Broadcasts like that)2- BIG (to me ) BUG  the issue?  as in the photograph.. I use Amazon Cloud Collections.  I organize my ebooks (most I got before I got the kindles)  using Calibre.  So  when I set up series, I use the Series name, or I use the Author, or Subject as a title for the Collections.  sometimes, (as in the case of the Dune series), books are added that happened in-between earlier books that came out.  So when that happens I will add the book. And when you have a series of say 11 books, 9 of which came out years ago, I'll add the book as the following:  01-Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of Dunethen 3 books were added.. Tales of Dune. Paul of Dune, and The Winds of Dune.In my older 7th Gen PW it showed like this:  00-Tales of Dune  01-Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  02.5-the Winds of Dune  03-Children of DuneBUT, As the photograph shows, the new 11th Gen PaperWhite has a bug!  00-Tales of Dune  01.5-Paul of Dune  01-Dune  02.5-the Winds of Dune  02-Dune Messiah  03-Children of DuneThis should REALLY be addressed!3-This is not so much a Kindle PW issue, as so much it's an Amazon issue.  and it deals with the Amazon Cloud Collections.  As I use Calibre, and I have a LOT of books that were originally Epubs, I used Calibre to convert them and organize them into series.  And after various different methods, including sideloading from the computer, I decided to use the Cloud Collections.  So I sent ALL of my converted epubs (now mobi files) to Amazon and used the website to organize them into the collections.  Which went very well ....at first.First..about 2-3 years ago, Amazon removed the ability to send the Collection to Device.  So now I HAVE to use the actual PW to get my Collections onto my Kindle.  Recently, Amazon changed the display format on the pages  on how they show books and doc files. And if you want to add a book or doc to a collection, it's now incredibly tedious! Formally when you did  a box would open that would let you start typing the name of the collection, or make a new collection.  All in one box.  NOW, a box open which shows 2 or 3 collections.. not in any order other than Recent..with a check box!  You can't find the collection by typing the title.. you can only scroll..and it only shows 2 collections at a time.  That's fine if you have 6 collections.. but I have 49 page of 5 COLLECTIONS EACH!!!  PLEASE PLEASE PUT BACK THE OLD WAY OR ADD A SEARCH OPTION!!  You've actually found a way that is so much more tedious than the actual Paperwhite!!!!! you can't even make a new one on there.. you have to go back to the collection Tab.. THEN go back to the doc or book tab and start all over!  Please go back to the old way !!!4- the new Library Series option.  It only works for purchased books, not docs.  also, I had to call up because it grouped two books together, in a series..(nice), but then stuck on e of the GRAYED OUT, above the first collection.. only in Download.  I found out I had to do a Reboot after turning Library option off. (I ended up putting the two books in a collection.. like I like.Well  that's about it.  btw  I  ALWAYS use the LIST vs GRID option.. and using HOME is no longer a nice choice.  I prefer when HOME was the same as LIBRARY .. in my case..the first collection, and all the collections after which comes the books in Recent ordernow... waiting for a dark brown cork case.______________________________________Slight update or comment on the software version.  My wife and I both upgraded to the 11th Gen.  Her's came with her case..Amazon Black Leather,  while I wait for the cork.  Her 11th gen came with 5.14.1 1,  while mine came with 5.14.0 .  I was a bit surprised since both were ordered at the same time. And arrived together.  But, not a big issue, since eventually all units will be on the latest software.  So? What to do?  I've read a LOT on here about complaints  it's so hard, I know.Since my ""update"" was grayed out,  I just downloaded the latest version and put it on my 11th gen,  and rebooted..and BINGO!  No problem,  I now have the latest software.Now fix the real BUG I addressed and fix the ""Manage Your Content"" pages regarding using Cloud Collections.  Oh, while you're at it, fix the damn Amazon Android App so I can work with Cloud Collections via the App. And not just my tower.  Thanks

    Kindle Signature Paperwhite plus Charging StandI own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here‚Äôs some of my particular findings in use.Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don‚Äôt like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device.  I purchased the ‚ÄúMoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear‚Äù from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off.  Thus, having Qi charging is helpful‚Ä¶not mandatory but helpful.  Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS.  The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded ‚Äúoff-line‚Äù reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.Auto-light adjust: I can‚Äôt even detect that it‚Äôs doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature.  Even those that wouldn‚Äôt pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as ‚Äúicing on the cake‚Äù for the price difference.  I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the ‚Äúwith ads‚Äù version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model.  And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly.  It does work with my ‚ÄúMoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear‚Äù., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I‚Äôm watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand.  I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model.  I find no issues with the size of the ‚Äúwall wart‚Äù or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge.  A ‚Äúwork around‚Äù for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.I‚Äôve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúpower user‚Äù. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers.  If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better‚Ä¶that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal.  Happy reading!

    The new paper white is terrific.  Sometimes when making an expensive purchase that I ""don't really need"" I feel a bit of buyers remorse.  But not this time.  I loved this thing right out of the box.  My friends have had different models over the years and I've always been impressed with the screen, and decided to pull the trigger this year on Prime Day.This new model is like reading actual print on paper.  It is very clear, especially outdoors.  I think it is more crisp either outdoors or under a reading lamp.  The text is a teenie-tiny bit fuzzy when using the backlight alone (ie. in the dark).  It totally works, but as a person who needs reading glasses I notice the difference.  I enjoy it most when used outdoors.I've also found that I read faster.  Turning the page is quick and easy.  And the Kindle is very light weight, it weighs less than my iPhone!!  It is easy to hold for long periods of time.Book purchasing is quick and easy.  You can buy on the Kindle, or from your PC and send-to the Kindle.  sorry iOS users, Apple has a stick up their butt so you can't buy from your phone.My only real complaint is the location of the power switch. It sticks out the bottom of the device and is easy to accidentally press.  For example, I was reading on a picnic bench in a park and was resting it and my arms in front of me when suddenly a dialog box appeared ""shutdown, reboot...""  I've also managed to turn it on while in my pocket or carrying it to a different room..  I would have located it on the top or recessed it.Nitpicky ""could be better""  It could use a lock-screen function so that I can carry it to another room. If you accidentally touch the screen, the pages start turning.  Or a different book opens, etc.  Currently the only option is turn it off.  The power options in settings are either ""sleep"" or ""deep sleep"" .  Maybe they could add a progressive ""soft-sleep for 10 minutes and then go into deep sleep"".  The default deep-sleep takes several seconds to wake up again.  Soft-sleep wakes faster but uses more battery.Another thing, backing up a page requires a Swipe whereas turning forward is a simple tap.  It would be nice if a tap in the left side was backwards (for cases when you fall asleep and the pages start turning :-D )Battery life so far has been 2 weeks between charges.  To get the claimed ""10 weeks"" you need to do a few things:  turn off wifi (apparently this is the big battery sucker and gets you 6 weeks) and turn off the backlight.  And Read Less. :-)  I leave wifi on so that it syncs immediately with my phone.  2 weeks is 2 weeks longer than my iPhone lasts.

    Worth the upgrade
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had several Kindles for more than a decade now, going all the way back to the Kindle Keyboard.  I usually replace them just to get desirable new features, and also because the trade-in/trade-up is always a good deal.  I read a lot every single day, up to 50 books a year in the past few years by balancing my attention away from so much toxic social media and taking advantage of Kindle Unlimited.  It's easy to get consumed by having a shiny device in your hand with infinite bites of short-attention-span content, taking all your attention away from reading a good book or even enjoying a good show or movie.  The Kindle Paperwhite is an aesthetically pleasing and covetable device that you can turn to for the experience of a beautifully printed page with crisp clean fonts and no paywalls popping up or asking you turn off your ad blocker or accept cookies, or sticking annoying ads between paragraphs.I love that this new Kindle has a bigger flush screen that goes closer to the edges.  I can read in the pool with one hand in extremely bright sunlight without any worries or eye strain.  At night I can switch it ti dark mode where it's white text on black background and puts off very little light to disturb my wife if I'm up late finishing a chapter.  It's got a USB-C port, which I like better because my only problem with older Kindles is when the USB Micro port would start to get loose.  Not sure if that would surely would be improved by this, but the fact that USB-C is reversible might make the difference.  Plus I think it charges faster and that's one less cable to pack.  The new adjustable color temperature setting is a feature I didn't think I'd care about but it's actually nice.  If I do some low-light reading with warmth on 3-4, then switch it back, the screen looks all blue and harsh.  This think is pleasant to read no matter how dark or bright it is.  Finally, it feels like there's still more performance improvements to this one.  It feels faster when I turn the page or scroll through my books.I can tell there's one corner of the screen that's just a bit yellowish even when the settings are for 0 warmth.  Lots of people have complained about even screen lighting in all the different Kindle Paperwhites.  It's probably the hardest thing to engineer, and this is not an expensive device.  What I find is that if the book I'm reading is good, I don't notice it at all.Amazon should do a subscription plan where you commit to 24 months of Kindle Unlimited and get the Kindle PaperWhite included, and then trade up at the end.  They'd still be selling the cases and upcharging for the higher models, but I think that would get more people reading a lot more and maybe draw even more authors to Kindle Unlimited.

    I have used Nook e-readers over the years.  A 2010 and 2015 model.  The 2010 is dead.  The later one is obviously outdated and hasn't been used for a while.  My wife used a very early Kindle Fire, also dead.  So, I was familiar with Amazon's eBook library and we had many books in our shared library.  I decided to update to a Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen) on Prime Day and it has proved a wonderful choice.  I've already read about 10 history books in just this last week and I'm looking for more..At 6.8"", the Kindle screen is larger than I've been used to, but that screen makes reading more pleasant and more like a real book.  I actually now prefer the landscape mode and have added a Pop Socket to hold the Kindle, since the bezel is pretty narrow.  (The PS sticks no problem to the soft rubbery back, after cleaning with alcohol).  I have noticed the back really shows greasy finger marks and isn't easy to wipe clean though.  The light weight and minimal thickness is really nice for holding for long durations.  I specifically don't use a cover, as I did with my Nooks, as that almost doubles the weight and ruins the experience..The touch control could be better, especially when trying to select highlights.  The page turns are awesomely quick and the screen illumination is smoothly consistent across the whole screen.  The 2015 Nook clearly showed where the LEDs were located!  The 300dpi screen is really nice with no pixelation to the letters.  I haven't had any ghosting issues either, with the screen page refresh option off.  The warmer screen option in dark situations is really nice to read with and I have it set to warm automatically for evening reading.  My eyes are much less strained..The non-Signature edition's capacity is fine for me.  I don't need to store the whole world's library on my e-reader.  I like to read no more than a couple books in parallel, with a handful to refer to, as required.  The battery life is absurdly (in a good way) long..In 12 years, the functionality of e-readers really hasn't changed much at all.  The improvements have been subtle, but much appreciated.  The way books are handled in the library is similar too!  The technology development has been much less dynamic on these than say, cell phones.  I guess there's not much you can do when the device is basically just for reading.  Eagerly awaiting a good color Kindle!  (Hint Hint)I do like the more modern design of the screen layout.  It actually is very similar to the old Kindle Fire my wife has and is actually about the same size.  Again, nothing really is that new in the e-reader world. The 11th Gen is now quite a bit thinner and lighter though!.I do wish Amazon, and others, weren't so restrictive with book formats and DRM's.  I can't read my many Nook books on my new Kindle!  There are plenty of books in the Amazon store though and I've already rebought some of my favorites, though reluctantly..SUMMARY:.Loving my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.!  It will keep me entertained and educated for a long, long time.  I highly recommend it.

    I have a first gen kindle that I received as a gift many years ago and it is still working great and battery life is still strong, and I read a lot. But it had no backlight and was hard to read at night. So, I diddled around trying to decide if I should get a new Paperwhite or not. I saw they were on sale, so I went for it. I bought the bundle deal. It came with the Paperwhite, cover, charger & cable. With the cover it does not seem to weigh any more than my old one without a cover.I have had it a couple of weeks now and I love it. It was so easy to set up and I thought I would have to give up my old kindle if I purchased a new one, but no. Now I have an extra one.I like that the cover that will shut it down when you close it and I do not have to push a button on the bottom. Reading is easy on the eyes; I have left it on the default.  It also can update my Goodreads account.What I find a slight annoyance is that if I leave the book and it shuts down on its own, I cannot just tap the screen to reopen it. I have to close the cover and re swipe to open. Not a big deal for me, just an extra step, but it is just something to note for someone who does not get the Amazon cover.When I received it, the battery was at around 70%. I fully charged it and I have been reading on it for two weeks for about 2 hours a day and it is at 73% right now. So, no complaints about battery life. My other kindle I carry around and read at work and it seems to have a slight longer battery life, but it does not have all the extras the Paperwhite has.

    AWESOME except for missing features and poor dark mode

    This thing performs so well in daylight and I look forward to reading more books outside regardless of sunlight conditions!  So if that's what you're looking for, this is your device.However, at night I like to read in Dark Mode (or reverse with white lettering on black background) and that is one are that this falls short.  I'm sure it has to do with how they designed the screen to be so good in daylight.  But when you switch it to Dark Mode, you get a washed out black background (let's call it gray or grey, whichever your preference).  So you don't get the sharp contrast that you will find with the other devices (e.g. iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android) that have a black background in reverse screen but suck in daylight viewing.  So it looks like I'll use the iPad mini for night reading and use the Paperwhite Kindle for daytime reading.  Not my preference, but that's the price to be paid for awesome daylight viewing.The second area that it falls short is that there are NO options to change the font size, etc.  So if you can accept that this displays pages much like a printed book where you get the font size, style and spacing as the publisher printed it, then you'll be fine.  I'm just familiar with the Kindle app on other devices where you can personalize the layout for better viewing.  I've looked high and low in the few setting selections that it comes with and I found nothing for that.  So I've decided to treat it like a printed novel where you have no choices on how it was printed, even though it is an electronic display.  Just imagine that it is printed paper and you'll be fine.The setting selections are very minimal.  It would be nice if you could select to have the time display on the bottom margin along with the page number and percentage complete, in my opinion.  Some people don't want to have that in view, but I'm often reading while waiting for brief periods of time and would like to keep an eye on the time without having to swipe the screen to view the time - which it is viewable (along with the date) on the quick settings display when you swipe down on the screen.This device is obviously optimized for daytime reading and it shines in that realm where other devices can't come close.  For a simple reading platform with no bells and whistles, it can't be beat - except in Dark Mode.  :-)UPDATED 7/26/22:  OK, I accidentally found where you can adjust the font size and select to have the time displayed or not.  Oddly you have to do a small swipe from the top to display that portion.  Apparently my swipes were always too aggressive and when I swiped a couple of inches, I would get the simple setting screen that didn't have those display options.After finding that I can get to the settings I was looking for by doing a short swipe, I added a star back onto my rating.  Still not able to give it the full five stars because the Dark Mode underperforms to my liking, but that is one small detriment when compared to how well it performs in daylight.

    great for travel
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I used to be a snob about paper being better than digital. But, my husband has a kindle that he loves and uses all the time. I started to want my own for travel and camping trips. It is really handy to be able to bring a LOT of books with you for a long plane ride or something. I also like that it's water resistant. I brought it to the beach a few times and didn't have to worry about splashes getting on it. I have had books get a little damaged on camping trips (cover bent or torn, pages wrinkled from high humidity) but didn't have to worry about that happening to the kindle. It's very lightweight and comfortable to hold with one hand. It's also a great option if you have a small house with limited storage for hoarding a lot of books.I like the way you can adjust the display as necessary: font size, brightness, white/amber spectrum for reading at night, etc.The screen doesn't have glare when reading outdoors and refreshes quickly when tapped to turn the page.So far the battery life has been amazing! I have had this device since May 2022 and I haven't needed to charge it yet. I keep the Bluetooth and wifi off unless I need to use those functions. That seems to conserve a lot of battery juice. When I first got it, I brought it on a trip, reading for several straight hours on airplanes and then about an hour or two per day for a week long trip, then lots of time reading on planes while traveling back home. Since I have gotten back home, I read for a few hours per week. At the time of writing this review, it is July 7, 2022 and I have now had the device for nearly 2 months. The battery hasn't gotten lower than 70% yet! Your mileage may vary, but I have been very impressed.My only real issue with this device is that is was a bit hard to figure out the navigation at first. There's no instructions in the box, and no tutorial when the setup has been completed. A lot of the navigation functions are hidden unless you tap on a specific area of the screen. As a millennial who is not as tech savvy as some other people my age, I had a bit of a panic when I couldn't figure out how to use it. I had to watch a YouTube video tutorial to learn where to tap to see the different menus! I can imagine someone like my mom or grandma really struggling to figure it out on their own because they are even less tech savvy than me! But once I knew where to tap, getting around the settings and navigating back to my library is not a problem anymore.I haven't tried using Kindle Unlimited or ebooks from my local library yet. But, I do check the ""kindle daily deals"" and sites like BookBub for discounts on ebooks. Generally ebooks are cheaper than paperbacks. So unless you are someone really thrifty who only buys used books, you are probably going SAVE money on books, instead of spending more. And, I just realized if you set up Amazon household so your account is linked with your spouse or parent who lives at the same address, you can then share ebooks between your accounts. After you purchase an ebook, from your Amazon account you can ""add to household library"" and then you can both access the same ebook. Which is great if your spouse or parent is also a book lover!

    I took advantage of Prime Days to get a Kindle. Now, I‚Äôve had a few days to evaluate it.I‚Äôve heard critics of the device say that they want the smell and feel of a ‚Äúreal book‚Äù and have no use for such a new-fangled device. Such remarks remind me of the late Phyllis Diller. She was notorious for her obsession with plastic surgery. When a reporter wanted to know how she felt about people who say they would never have such surgery because they think nature should take its course, she responded: ‚ÄúWell, let those people grow old gracefully then.‚Äù  Fear of anything different seems to hold folks back more than a granite wall.If you think a conventional book is better than a Kindle, you might as well get an icebox, throw out your refrigerator, live without air-conditioning, build yourself an outhouse, and get your liquor from an old fruit jar. Okay, maybe that‚Äôs a little strong; I, too, like holding a book. But from now on, they‚Äôll need to be room in my life for both.Perhaps your hesitation about getting a Kindle is because you don‚Äôt really love reading that much or don‚Äôt completely understand all a Kindle can do for you. The Kindle is to the book what a book is to drawings on a cave wall. In the next paragraph, I‚Äôm going to sell you on getting a Kindle, and I don‚Äôt even get a commission. I will, however, accept your thank you.You probably already know that you can read a Kindle in the dark or outside in bright sunlight, and the screen is no-glare. But did you know that you can press on a word and the dictionary definition will pop up? You can press and hold while you run your finger across a sentence, paragraph, page, or whatever and it will highlight the same way you would use a highlighter for a book. It will stay highlighted unless you delete the highlight. You also have the option to write a note on anything in the text you want: a word, a paragraph, a page, whatever. You can even email your highlights and notes to yourself. When you stop reading, the Kindle will keep your place. The battery life is insanely long, and the device is much easier to hold than a regular book.If that paragraph didn‚Äôt convince you, let me add one more fact: you can get a high-capacity Kindle for a little more money than I spent. However, the one I got ‚Äì the Paperwhite 6.8 -- gives me a good view and, with 8 GB, will hold an average of 2000 - 3000 books. I said, two to three thousand books. Thank me later.

    The upgrade I love but didn't need
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This review is for the new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen (8 GB). First of all, I must say that this Kindle feels great. It might feel a tiny bit heavier than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen, but this is honestly hardly noticeable.I love my old PW and just wanted to upgrade to a newer model because of the slightly larger screen, Bluetooth capabilities, and the warm light.It never occurred to me that I could have any issues with the screen, so imagine my surprise when I turned it on and immediately noticed a dead/stuck pixel on the left upper side of the screen. People on the Internet say this is a manufacturing issue, and there is no way it will disappear on its own. I can see it there, even when the screen is dimly lit. To be honest after a while, I forget it's there and in some cases, the words ""cover"" it up. I don't mind this tiny flaw.The Kindle feels great. Reading is even more enjoyable now. The ability to control the amount of warm light alone makes this Kindle worth the upgrade.I think that 8GB is more than enough if your idea is to store books. Now, if you are thinking of downloading audiobooks too, then 8GB are still enough. That is, if you are not planning on downloading hundreds of books at the time... I rely on the cloud to store my books.It seems that the audiobooks will come from Audible. I don't see (or haven't really looked for) a way to sideload them or use any other store to get them. So, if you're not a prime member or don't have an audible subscription, chances are you won't be using the audio book feature much.I noticed that if you enable the ""listen"" feature, you cannot read along. I can do this on the Kindle App, and as a non native speaker, I like having this option since I get to check on pronunciation of unknown words.Overall, I'm super happy with this unnecessary purchase and fully recommend the upgrade to anyone. I got my new Kindle like two days before Prime Day and paid full price for it... Even at full price, I don't regret it.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I forgot how much I missed a regular Kindle. The last kindle I had was the Kindle fire, so it has been several years. This is much easier on the eyes than the Kindle fire, the Nook color, or the iPad.  And reading on the iPad or the Kindle fire, I found I was always interrupted with a text, or an email, or a phone call when it was linked to my phone. I had initially liked the idea of a tablet that had everything in one place, but it does interfere with reading, I find. I am really liking the Kindle, as just a device for reading.  It‚Äôs also less (or maybe no?) blue light, and I read before bed, so not using a tablet/computer may help or be better for sleep.  It is very light weight, and the suggestions/adds on the lock screen don‚Äôt bother me.  Page turning is easy, but it is sometimes ‚Äútricky‚Äù to get into and out of other menus.  It takes a little getting used to, as the response is different than other touchscreens, in my opinion.  It takes a while to find your ideal brightness and warmth settings (I like about 16-18 brightness and no warmth during the day.  I set it to shift to warmer in the evening/early morning). Just be aware, if you are used to reading on a tablet, you will lose the color images on the Paperwhite.  No big deal, unless you read a lot of cookbooks, graphic novels, or other animated content.  Still, if you have the Kindle app on another tablet or computer, it‚Äôs easy to switch between the two, if you want.  It came 50% charged. I bought the charging plug too.  Like many people state, it should really just come with the plug, but most things don‚Äôt now, so I don‚Äôt really hold that against Amazon in this case.  I‚Äôve always been afraid of using ‚Äúoff-brand,‚Äù discount plugs/cables; so, I figured why not just buy a new one.  I‚Äôve also turned off WiFi to save battery: that‚Äôs not just a toggle on/off, either.  You just have to use the Airplane Mode to turn WiFi off/on.  So far, so good, and I‚Äôm glad I made the purchase.

    Life Saver! Never Gonna Give It Up!

    The Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation is perfect for whenever and wherever you like to read. The warm light option and 8g of storage is a game changer. If you don‚Äôt own a Kindle or want an upgrade, buy this one now!This device is a lifesaver, literally! During a business trip to Costa Rica our yacht accidentally caught on fire which distracted the captain as the ship oversteered, hitting a rock! The yacht capsized and sank into the depths of the ocean along with the entire crew. Luckily I bought the cork cover for my new Kindle and it kept me afloat. After a couple of days swimming, and reading, I safety landed on Coco Island. One day later a fellow crew member made their way to the island as well. Alas, we we‚Äôre the only survivors from our humble business vessel. Unlike the water-soaked book my colleague was able to dredge up on the sand my Kindle Paperwhite was in perfect condition. As dusk fell upon the lonely island I watched him struggle to read as I adjusted the built-in light and turned up the warm light option with ease. For the next eight days he read the same book over and over again (what was left of it). Fortunately for me I had my entire library with me and looked forward to days/weeks (?!) of uninterrupted reading time. On one particularly peaceful day I realized that I had quietly transitioned into the role of our business yacht‚Äôs sole survivor. Anyhow, the next day a rescue chopper found me and delivered me to safety.I am eternally grateful for my Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation. I will never give it up, never gonna put it down, never gonna run around or desert it.

    My previous Kindle Paperwhite was 5 years old and having trouble keeping a charge.  I wanted to upgrade to the new waterproof version, but due to so many negative reviews, I kept putting it off.  Then finally, the deal on Prime Day was too good to resist and I took the plunge.  I do not regret it!First of all, I have a pool and also vacation at the beach often, so knowing that this could get splashed and possibly dropped in the water without being damaged is a huge plus.  I've already spent many hours with this in my pool and so far so good.  I like that the screen is a bit larger than my old one, which is easier on the eyes and less page turns.  The battery holds up just as well as my old Paperwhite originally did.  I can read 5 or 6 books without having to charge.  I didn't think I'd use it, but the nighttime setting is great, automatically adjusting the brightness at a set time of my choosing.The only negatives I can come up with is that the larger screen means a more narrow space to hold the Kindle,  resulting in some accidental page turns.  And I wish there were better options for water resistant cases.  The one I bought is fine but a bit pricey and not completely water resistant.Overall, I highly recommend.

    Overall, I LOVE my new kindle paperwhite. Can't stress enough that it really has overall been a great purchase. I love having a dedicated e-reading device as other things don't interupt and distract my reading time, etc... I now refuse to read e-books on any other device as I much prefer reading on my Kindle.Pros:-Absolutely love the adjustable warm/blue light options and dark/light mode (as I can read comfortably in the dark without disturbing others)-In love with the fact its waterproof so I can read in the tub/pool/etc...-wifi connectivity awesome feature-The kindle store experience isn't as good as it is on a tablet/smart phone but was way better than expected-size and weight are just right for holding and reading.-I've read it several hours a day and the battery still managed to last at least a week plus. And if I don't read as often and leave it in airplane mode with bluetooth off it lasts a very, very, very long time without re-charging. So no complaints there.Cons:- Biggest con is as of 2022 kindle paperwhite doesn't support immersion reading (i.e., listening to audiobook and seeing book text at the same time) you can only do one or the other/switch between the two. As an exclusive e-reading device I was very disappointed it doesn't support this particular feature.-It occasionally glitches either skipping ahead by several pages, or makes me tap/swipe a few times when I attempt to navigate backwards in my book. Its not a deal breaker as it happens rarely but still can be slightly annoying at times. This may also improve with updates in the future.-The screen does smudge quite easily/noticably but when reading you can't really tell-a little sad it doesn't have its own speakers to listen to audiobooks, but I knew this buying it and it does connect well to my bluetooth devices. Also, not including internal speakers does keep it very slim which is nice.-There are one or two e-books I own that ""aren't formatted"" for the kindle so I can't read them, but its quite rare. Also I wouldn't recommend reading comic books, graphic novels, or childrens picture books on a kindle as they are all black and white and don't show color (and the pages are smaller and text can be quite difficult to read) However none of these books really read well on normal tablets/smartphones either as they are usually best as hard copies. That being said my toddler still enjoyed reading the one or two kids picture e-books I do own on the device. But its best and really designed for text only chapter books for older kids/adults.Other comments: other reviewers mentioned that the power button is not in a good location as its on the bottom of the device. They stated they occasionally accidentally turn it off while reading (especially if you hold it right handed). I agree its in a bad spot/is slightly inconvenient but it hasn't caused me to accidentally turn it off. So overall this hasn't been an issue for me.Overall I would buy it again, and I would definitely purchase the paperwhite over the standard kindle if you can afford to (although the standard is still a good experience).

    A little more buggy than previous generations
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love Kindle!  I've owned one almost since they were introduced (remember the keyboard Kindle!) and they have literally changed the way I read.  No more locked onto so called best selling authors because now I can discover the absolutely amazing talent that exists out there in the independent world.  It also lets me tote as many books as I want on vacation without needing a separate suitcase for reading materials.And, every generation of Kindle has seen an improvement, some dramatic, some subtle.  This one is on the subtle side if you own a 2018 version.  Yes, the screen is bigger but so is the whole unit (marginally but still bigger) which is not necessarily a check mark in the plus column.  The screen shows fingerprints badly, just like the 2018 version so a screen saver is helpful if you can get it installed properly.  I really like the USB-C charging - a small idea but one I can appreciate.Where I have some issues with this generation is that it seems buggier than any version before.  Sometimes the page forward doesn't work until you do a page back first and then all is well for about another twenty pages and then the behavior repeats itself.  It doesn't always turn on/off with the cover close and I've tried two different covers so think it's the unit itself.  The first thing I did when I took it out of the package was to update it but it has since, on its own, gone into that update screen when there wasn't actually any update to download.  It doesn't wipe anything out, just prevents use for a few minutes.I may have a faulty unit or it's some of the non-Amazon books I'm reading (Gutenberg mostly so they should be malware free but who knows).  It's not enough to return the item since Amazon tends to replace brand new purchases with refurbished ones.If I had but one suggestion for Amazon, it would be to build in a circuit that would allow you to plug a device into the USB port that would have two buttons on a pod and on a longish cord that would let you remotely turn pages.  It would be really helpful in the gym while on the cardio equipment like an AMT.  You could attach the pod to the handles of the AMT and just tap the page turn button to read.

    The best Kindle available - beats Oasis
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    E-readers are supposed to emulate the experience of reading a physical book as closely as possible and this new Paperwhite is by far the best e-reader on the Amazon lineup and the entire market.The 300ppi display makes for ultra smooth and hyper-realistic text (and gorgeous images on the lockscreen). Corners and edges look dangerously sharp, lines look pin-straight and un-pixelated, and adjustable brightness and warm light allow for a perfect combination of comfort and realism. The 6.8"" screen allows for more visible text on a page and is only 0.2"" away from the screen size of an Oasis. The brightness of this display can be turned up to 11 and I highly doubt that anyone, even with impaired vision and in the worst lighting conditions, would ever need to max it out. And I like my screens brighter than most. Trust me, you don't need a higher LED count.The flush-face design is attractive with the downsized bezels around the screen and still provide enough real estate to hold the device. The USB-C port is a must in 2022, the power button is unobtrusive at the bottom of the device (although I would've preferred it placed at the top), and the device itself has a good weight at just under a half-pound. Note: this Kindle is ever so slightly heavier than its predecessors including the Oasis, but is still more than comfortable enough to manipulate in one hand for extended periods of time.The hardware and software pairing as of April 2022 feels well married. Older reviews have expressed judgement of earlier software versions, but as of today I can report no issues. Pages turn a little quicker, loading screens take less time in decision making, and switching between books and other applications feel faster than ever.My only judgements about this Kindle are as follows:I would've preferred different placement for the lock-button but this isn't a functional issue.I wish this Kindle was available in more colors.I exchanged this Kindle before writing this review because I received my first one with a pinhole defect in the display. I believe this was due to shipping conditions because the packaging was minimal and the device was placed at the bottom of the shipping box, underneath only a top layer of bubble packing. So, I wish these shipped with better care.All in all, if wireless charging and auto-adjusting brightness isn't important to you (and it shouldn't be), this Kindle is the one for you. No one needs 32gb of storage in an e-reader, and if you do, it means you're probably neglecting your local library and/ or personal collection of printed books. Shame on you. Thousands of books can be stored in the base 8gb configuration so I truly believe that 32gb is totally unnecessary. Skip the Signature Edition and save a buck.You can always upgrade to ""ad-free"" at a later date by paying an additional $20 so try the ad-supported version first to test the waters. They only appear on the lockscreen anyway. Kindle Unlimited is laughable unless you strictly read B-level romance novels, so feel free to skip a 3 month trial subscription option at the time of purchase if a Kindle without that option selected will ship faster. You'll also get an offer upon setting up your Kindle for the same 3 month trial, so even if you'd like to try it you'll have the opportunity the moment you login to your Amazon account. The offer will also be forwarded to your email upon initialization.Buy this one, you won't regret it.

    I never thought I needed a separate device just for reading. I have an iPad Pro and have always just used that for reading books. The Kindle Paperwhite is night and day. It weighs next to nothing, and is so comfortable in the hand and small enough to go in any purse. I'm not sure what sorcery was used to create this thing, but the screen makes the text look EXACTLY like a paperback book. I spend about 6 hours a day reading books or other documents. I have never had any sort of eye strain that I usually get from my phone or ipad due to the warming feature. It is very easy to upload work documents from my computer to the kindle, and of course the kindle library is massive. The only thing that ipad has over kindle is if you are a big annotator/highlighter when you read. Kindle does have this feature, but it is not as simple as it is on an ipad. Don't spend the money on the ad-free version. The only ads present are when you turn the kindle off and an ad pops up as a screensaver. It's not like an ad will randomly pop up when you're reading or anything.Amazon says that Kindle paperwhite will last about 6 weeks without charge. Like I said, I use mine about 6 hours a day, and I have to charge it maybe every 2 weeks. I still think that is a great battery!

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have had several previous versions of the Kindle and Paperwhite that we absolutely loved. Each version offers more and this one is a no-brainer.  With the waterproofing (which I need with a Granddaughter around) and the new warm light display, this thing is a charm to use and read with.  I keep mine loaded with books and periodicals that could come in handy if my wife goes on a prolonged visit to her favorite stores. It also makes it easier to read in bed even if my wife dozes off, as to not wake or keep bothering her with the light.  It's size is perfect for reading (a little larger than a paperback) and very lightweight. The back helps keep a grip and soft so if I manage to fall asleep while reading, I don't give myself a concussion!  With a newer USB-C port, charging is made easier with my newly purchased Anker charger. The display is now seamless across the screen to the edges making it much better to hold. I know the higher priced Kindle reader comes with physical page-turn buttons, but I have not needed or miss these at all.  Screen refreshes seem much faster on this version also.  If you like to real a lot (or a little) and need a way to read without having to keep a pile of books, this Kindle Paperwhite is the way to go!

    This is a great kindle. It does what it's advertised to do. It's the best digital book you can buy at this price point. It does play your audiobooks as advertised once you pair bluetooth headphones to the device.What it doesn't do that your free iPhone/Android kindle app does is simply a deal breaker for anyone alive today who's brain is rendered absolutely useless by TikTok and other short attention span stimuli. This feature is called immersive reading. And, it's the only way I have been able to ween myself off of my iPhone addiction.I was gifted my kindle for Father's Day. It was a lovely gift. I downloaded a ton of books. I was so excited to read in the pool. I read for exactly 13 milliseconds before I was distracted. I sat by the pool and read for another 23 milliseconds before I picked up my iPhone and scrolled through TikTok for the next consecutive 4 hours.I then found, what I learned to call, immersive reading by searching for ""can audible read my kindle books to me"". Immersive reading is absolutely fantastic. It reads the book to you and highlights as it's reading. You're reading along as the audio keeps you focused. I have plowed through 400 and 700 page books in days like I was back in middle school. This can't be my same brain....I have abandoned my kindle, for now, to use immersive reading on my iPad and iPhone. I hope to return a recovered iPhone addict one day. But, I would also return should a software update bring this feature to the kindle paperwhite. I do not think I would buy a newer/other kindle model to get this feature. It's just to easy to use the IPhone/iPad app for no extra cost..

    My old kindle was the keyboard, and I love my kindle I just would get into issues where I would read so late in the night and I had to have a light. It would wake my husband. So I wanted the illuminated screen. For me I go dark mode. I prefer it black with white lettering. It is still illuminated but not so much that it is too bright. I have found it easy to maneuver around in it and my books are great. I like I can just tap screen with my thumb too. Very easy reading! I love it so much and I am glad I finally switched! I sat on it a long time trying to decide!What I also love is it connects to amazon kids too for my kids reading books!!!I find the response time is perfect for me, and again easy to use. Very happy I got it.My only thing is there was one small pixel out and I was trying to decide what to do about that. But it isn't anywhere that bothers me too much. So I just went with it. Love it!And I love the old one too, I just like that this has the illuminated screen and touch.Oh and it is water safe, which I see others are like but why!?! But me I love taking a bath and reading and now I am not worried if I accidentally drop it. Which I have done before.

    This is personally my 3rd Kindle, 1st in the Paperwhite series.  This is the 6th Kindle and 3rd Kindle Paperwhite we've had between my wife and I. This Paperwhite 11th Gen is replacing my Kindle Voyage.  The Voyage was smaller, lighter, and had a longer battery life (in the beginning). But the Paperwhite 11th Gen is still a better device.  On the Paperwhite the screen is more adaptable to light changes and slightly more touch responsive, the device charges faster, and I like the operating system better (software and hardware). I've only had t for a week so I haven't run it through all it's paces yet, but I am excited about the water resistance and potential for Bluetooth connection. I read while floating in a pool or while sitting at the beach so I expect the water resistance feature will come in very handy!I did have 1 hiccup with the device.  Last night the touch screen  suddenly stopped responding. I couldn't open the menu or turn the page.  I pressed the power button to put it to sleep, waited a few seconds, and then pressed the power button again to wake it back up.  I suspect the more advanced software will need to be rebooted occasionally (like a cellphone or computer needs to be rebooted occasionally). This is probably a minor thing, but it could be annoying for someone who's not used to trouble shooting tech issues.

    I have an 11 year old Kindle 3 with Keyboard that is still working perfectly. I decided to trade it in on Prime Day for the Paperwhite to test out the new features. Big mistake.One of the biggest differences is supposed to be the improved screen resolution. That might be the case for illustrations, magazines, or comics, but I don‚Äôt use a Kindle tor that. I could not see any significant improvement when it came to books. One nice addition is the lighting range where you can go from the brightest bright to a reverse darkness with white lettering on a black screen for late night reading. I will miss that but the old black lettering on a grey screen has always been a good middle ground for me. The Paperwhite screen is also bigger for fewer page turns and that was nice but it also shrunk the border bezels which caused other problems.  But page turns were a mess.A light tap on the right side of the screen would often jump ahead two pages and the same could happen going back. It happened enough that I couldn‚Äôt trust I was on the correct page. Two times a single tap advanced close to 40 pages. There is an option to turn off the touchscreen and just swipe to advance pages but when I did that the screen would freeze up and not respond to swipes. Well this is an enjoyable way to read.Regarding the thinner bezels: if you have large hands, reading can be a bit like whack-a-mole. If you are holding it with one hand, which I do most of the time, it is easy to inadvertently brush the screen which results is a page turn you didn‚Äôt want. At that point you just feel lucky if it only advanced a single page. My old Kindle 3 is a bit larger and a few ounces heavier but I find it much more comfortable to hold in one hand, especially with the page buttons. The Paperwhite really needs a screen sensitivity option.So I decided to return the Paperwhite and keep my old Kindle. The battery will eventually stop working but I can replace that for $15.00. So I deregister the Paperwhite for shipment and now it would not power off. I tried everything short of a hammer. After wasting a half hour I called Amazon for assistance as I didn‚Äôt want to pack a powered device and at this point I knew it was not going to turn itself off. The rep was great and it still took 75 minutes on the phone to shut it off. At one point I asked the rep if I could bash it to death with a hammer and use our recorded call as justification for the exchange. Or drive a stake through its Kindle heart. I believe she gave it serious consideration.There were some other nice menu options but who cares if reading a book is so dam frustrating. I could have exchanged it for another one but in those cases Amazon may replace it with a returned/refurbished item. Not a new one. I know the vast majority of people are very satisfied with the Paperwhite but they don‚Äôt know how great the Kindle 3 still is, even with the physical keyboard that takes forever to enter anything.

    This Kindle replaces my nine year old one, and its come a long way!  It‚Äôs slightly bigger in size to hold, compared to my older one, but the differences are amazing in the workings of it.  It is very touch responsive.  Just a quick touch and it turns the page forward or back.  Same for the settings at the top.  Everything is so quick.  It took me a bit to figure out all the settings and I think I am still learning, but its been great fun.  Before I got my cover for it, I had to turn it off and on manually.  The screen would pop right up.  Now with the cover it puts it to sleep when I close it, and turns it on immediately when I open the cover.  Such a difference from my old one!  And the screen is so much brighter and crisper and clearer.  It‚Äôs such a pleasure to read from it!

    Love my latest kindle!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I bought my first kindle paperwhite almost 10 years ago.. since then I have bought about 8-9 devices.. mostly fire tablets as a gift for family.. nephews and nieces. But I stuck to my original kindle paperwhite since I loved the natural feel of the screen. Finally after nearly a decade and slowly down significantly, my kindle paperwhite died. So I started looking for a replacement among all these ‚Äúgeneration‚Äù of kindle  and fire tablets. Finally I found this one during Prime Day, it had great reviews, I got a major discount due to prime day and it was shipped to me in 2 days. The transfer of all my books was super easy from the kindle website. The new one has a lot of space for storing more books. It has audible functionality added too. Last but not the least, it still has the perfect screen for reading.. ‚Äúpaper white‚Äù is not false advertising. Now I‚Äôm the settings, with brightness you can also adjust warmth. This is especially helpful for me since I read at night in bed. Also if you purchase or borrow books in a series, it puts them all together in serialized format so you can find it in one place in your library.All in all, I‚Äôm very happy with my kindle, I hope it survives my reading habits and lasts a decade like my old one. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

    Since the very beginning of the e-reader era, I had always sworn I would never purchase one.  I was proud of being a biblio-purist, and felt that e-readers we're an affront to the ancient, iconic charms of printed literature. Reading a good book could  not possibl provide the same experience when done so through the cold and impersonal electronic haze that encased e-readers.  How could one derive the same experience that was provided from physical flipping throught dog-eared pages showing sings if all those who had tried through those printed words countless times before, and more to come.  Feeling the best of it in your hands carrying the weight of reality, the ever-changing smells that evolved during a book's lifetime from papermill-new, the must and dust that could create olfactory imagery from old, well-used libraries, and the character of cigar-lounds and cognac snifters.  These sensations could add timeless, hefty qualities to the works of literature contained therein.  I also found afront in that electronic literature kept readers away from the already dying icon of the corner bookstore, and the charms of slowly perusing aisles and aisles of books with others who shared a similar driving passion.  And to sip an afternoon capucino on the front patio of such a bookstore was a sublime pleasure that compared to no others.Then slowly, insidiously over the course of years, my reading frequency decreased.  Part of it was due to the inevitable demands for time and attentions that increased age brings with increased responsibilities, but a large part was played by less and less time and energy I had available to make it to the bookstore or library.  Slowly at first, but inevitable to the point at which I had simply quit reading without being accutely conscious of it.  In would purchase an occasional book, but found that reading simply had become increasingly difficult to make happen.  Books would get left in public places, or otherwise lost.  Finding room for one in napsack before going on an afternoon bike ride impeded the desire to read.  Sometimes I justwould tire of the unavoidable spills, stains, and mistreatments that eventually occured to my books, through no lack of love but due to my somewhat active and chaotic lifestyle.Then one day after watching a new film adaptation of one of my favorite novels, I had the strong urge to re-read the book.  I, however, was on a late-night work schedule that made it extremely challenging to conduct any sort of business or errand-running during daylight hours.  Being a devoutly active Amazonian, I was aware of a recent significant sale on Kindles.  I ran through a few thought-processes and determined there was little risk of harm in making a small investment in the potential re-Kindling of a long-lost love.I can't put my Kindle down.  I am utterly amazed at the e-ink technology that allows this reading magic to happen.  I'm in love with the changeable, resizeable fonts (I can actually read even if I've mis-placed my glasses).  The dictionary look-up feature, the ability to highlight passages, easily flip through pages and bookmark them easily, the adjustable side-lighting and color temperature... have all enamored me with the device and customizable technology.  And the ability to carry an entire library around with me in my pocket still boggles my mind!I have read more in the month and a half that I've owned my Kindle than I have in the last 2 or  3 years.I'm a romantic, tactile person, and while it is a bit nostalgically sad that independent booksellers are losing business and may indeed be a dying breed... well, times change and not always in the precise way we'd like them to.  But if e-readers can promote and increase reading and the appreciation of literature, while possibly removing some roadblocks to publication for young, unestablished authors... well I can't see that as a bad thing.

    I've been reading on my Fire 8HD for years. In the past I've kept an old Fire for reading and used a newer one for games, videos, and everything else, but my ""old"" Fire died a few months back and I'd been trying to decide whether to replace it or get the Paperwhite. I wasn't really sure I needed a Paperwhite. It made no sense to me that my Fire cost less than a Paperwhite, so I wasn't rushing to buy one in spite of the rave reviews. Recently when I wasn't feeling well though, the reflections on the Fire's screen were bothering me and my eyes were getting tired. I'd never really noticed the reflections because I usually read at night in the dark, although it has been a bit of a bother reading on airplanes. That got me thinking that maybe a Paperwhite was something to consider, but the screen looked awfully small and I thought that might be annoying.  I decided to wait for Prime Day and get one with the birthday gift cards I knew were coming. I'm so glad I did! The Paperwhite is so light! It's a lot lighter than a book or my Fire. I got a case that has double hand straps so I can hold it comfortably in either hand.  It makes reading more enjoyable because I don't get tired of holding it, and I can read in any position. It looks cute on my nightstand in its pretty cover too. I haven't even played with any of the settings, but I'm now a Paperwhite fan.

    I bought this on prime day, with the case and charging combo. My boyfriend told me I should buy one as I always read books on my phone. I didn't think it would be a huge improvement to my phone, I didn't think I would use it nearly as much as I have been! This is amazing. I love how crisp the text is and how easy it is to customize the font type, size, and boldness. Downloading new books is simple, having kindle unlimited is great, so many books are offered.  When reading before bed, I turn the warmth up and it doesn't hurt my eyes at all. I just can not get over how crisp the text is! I love how it is lightweight and easy to hold. The water resistance is a plus, have yet to read in the bath! Lol.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve been on the fence for years on buying a kindle. Decided to get one on the recent Prime Day deals. Chose the Paperwhite over the base model due to higher ppi and water resistance.Never owned a kindle before so not sure but from reading reviews the Paperwhite is supposed to have a more responsive screen. The base model must suck because the Paperwhite is sluggish in 2022 compared to a smartphone or tablet. If my iPad were so slow, I‚Äôd throw it against the wall. BUT, as the kindle is purely for reading and nothing else it is totally fine. The delay when pressing a button and getting the desired response is minimal and acceptable for browsing the store and turning pages. That‚Äôs really the only negative and it is easily forgivable.After having tried to read a few books over the years on an iPad, the kindle is a revelation for my eyes. No strain and a very comfortable and pleasant reading experience. Have read for hours on end which was never really possible or enjoyable on an iPad. Love that it is waterproof and can use it at pool or beach.With the ability to borrow ebooks from my local library, this thing is amazing and well worth the initial investment. If you read novels and like to get lost in them for hours on end, it‚Äôs a no brainer. Makes borrowing library books much more convenient, as well as saving money vs physical prints of a book. Save money, no waste. Battery lasts forever too.

    All good except I miss dedicated page turn buttons like old Kindles or Voyage
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Everything is good in this new Paperwhite model, I like the bigger size and the backlighting with variable ""warmth"", plus the optional dark mode of white text on black background for night reading.I don't like the lack of dedicated page turn buttons -- I've always had older Kindles with buttons, most recently a Voyage, and I find it distracting and annoying to have to touch the screen carefully somewhere on the righthand side to advance forward one page, especially if I'm trying to hold the device in just my left hand, as I would often do with the older models having dedicated page turn buttons along the left edge. So I can't use this Kindle entirely one-handed like I used to with older ones (even holding it just in my right hand, it's awkward having to extend a finger carefully to touch somewhere in the righthand side of the screen to advance the page forward instead of just having a nice button to press).Oh one other thing that's sub-optimal is that in the new OS/UI there's no more generic/universal ""Back"" button/link icon. Most noticeable when I'm reading a story in a magazine; with older models and older OS/UI there was a ""back"" button, either hardware or software, so I could use the ""home"" button/link icon to jump out to the ""library"" listing, and then use the universal ""back"" button/link icon to jump back directly to the page I'd been reading in the story in the magazine. Now I have to go through several steps, thinking about what to do/touch next, to go through this cycle, and it annoys me each time.Plus, one more thing I don't like in the new OS/UI is that in the Library listing when I have some Collections, previously in the overall view it would only show collections and individual items that weren't in any collection. So I could ""hide"" a bunch of books inside collections, not having to scroll past them in the main library view of items not in any collection.But now, in the overall view, it shows collections and ALL downloaded individual items, including ones that I wanted to hide from this view by putting them in a collection. What's the point of adding them to a ""collection"", if they're still just going to all be visible in the main library list?Other than these few things I don't like about the new OS/UI and the lack of a physical page forward button on the left or bottom edge of the device, I do like this new Paperwhite (it's my first Paperwhite; I had the original Kindle when it first came out, then some years later I had one with no keyboard but still having physical buttons along the bottom and sides, and then I had a Voyage for a few years, before deciding to upgrade to this new Paperwhite).

    My Gen. 11 Kindle Paperwhite has adjustable warm light (yes!), and a larger screen at 6.8‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt sound like a much bigger screen, but the outer dimensions add up to feeling more like a book, at 4.9‚Äù x 6.9‚Äù overall. I find it easier to read than my previous Kindles, and I always add the Decal Girl matte ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù skin. I also find it useful to have the Spigen grip on the back near the top, as the edges are narrow. A PopSocket would work, as well. I‚Äôve had a Kindle since the 2nd generation, after they got past the ‚Äòklunky‚Äô style of the first one.

    I had previously read my kindle books on my phone (hard on the eyes) , or on a couple of laptops. (Better on the eyes but bulky).  After getting the Kindle paperwhite, I've been reading tons more because it's just soooooo much easier on my (admittedly old) eyes.  The size is something close to a small paperback. Just a bit big for a pocket.  But who stuffs a book into your pocket?It does pretty much suck as a general browser.  But I have my phone and laptops for that.Getting new content is best done on the phone or laptops and specify delivery to the Kindle.The touch controls require a little trial to get used to.  But they are needed very little compared to the time you are just reading.I'm really glad I got it.

    Over the years I've owned just about every kindle that Amazon has offered. What a long ways they have come from the very first one! This new Gen 11 Kindle is very easy to use and is very similar to the 10 generation but with some nice upgrades. I was very happy to see that the larger screen did not add any noticeable weight compared to the 10 generation Kindle. The larger screen is great for us who have older eyes lol. You adjust the letters to make them little bigger in size on this 11 generation Kindle. I also love the feature with the amber night light. Now you can read in the dark without eye strain from a brighter lighted screen. Also, this new Kindle was so easy to set up! Out of the box I just turned it on, set up the Wi-Fi code, and entered my Amazon account information and all my books from my 10ty generation Kindle were right there waiting for me. The touch screen is much more responsive on this new kindle and the settings are easier to work with now. All in all very happy with my new kindle 11th generation.

    This is a nice Kindle to read, I bought this to replace my 8 year old Paperwhite which I broke the screen.This one is easy to read, visually, it's a nice improvement.The low rating is due to almost daily needs to restart the device.  I'll open the Kindle to a white page, I then have to restart and reopen the book that I was reading.  I also frequently lose the progress that I had when I need to restart.This would get a 5 star rating if it worked as well as my old Paperwhite.  I think I needed to restart that twice in 8 years.Note:  I am leaving my original review above, after posting the review, I received an email from Amazon customer service with instructions on correcting the problems I listed in the original review.  The Kindle works as expected now.  I am also happy with the unexpected email from Amazon.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    So, I never really thought I would get this version of the kindle because well a kindle isn't really something that you upgrade when the new version comes out. It's something that you upgrade when your old one breaks, and you must upgrade it. Well, I lost my 10th Gen kindle paperwhite at work, so I decided to order this one. I love it. The newer display refreshes just a bit faster than the older one did, and the fact that it's bigger and has smaller bezels really does a lot to make this new kindle feel modern. Another thing is that it now charges via USB C. This is amazing because it means every single one of my portable electronic devices can be charged with my laptop charger.The one real complaint I have with my new Kindle is the physical size of the device. While I appreciate the larger screen, they wish they could have shrunk the bezels on the older model without actually making the footprint bigger. As a guy who usually wears cargo shorts or cargo pants I could always put my old Kindle in my front pocket. I never had to think about putting it in a bag or make sure that I had a jacket pocket to put it in because it would just fit in my pants or shorts pocket. This is a minor complaint, but if you have an older candle and it fits very exactly into a pocket or bag the new one might not fit as well. Also, Amazon please stop putting the power button on the bottom of the device. Put it on the top of the side, it would be more ergonomic there.

It's super light weight and easy to take in my purse to get my nails done, wait at the doctor's office, etc. and I'm reading so much more because of it. I do recommend a case as the screen scratches pretty easily, especially if putting it in various bags/purses versus just sitting on your nightstand or around your house. There are a lot of features to adjust to the perfect reading light and brightness/warmth, and I love being able to read at night without an overhead light or lamp on.

    Got this to read outdoors/after a long day of working on computers to help my eyes with strain. This style of screen is SO satisfying. I tried an old version to see if I would like this style and this is thinner, with more screen area, and moves much more quickly than older models. I was able to get it at an incredible deal during a sale and it was more than worth the $80 I paid. My new favorite device for sure. I'm reading more and it helps with my unwinding routine at night to not look at another bright screen. A physical book is lovely but I only have so much space - renting ebooks from the library is easy to do and I can take multiple books with me everywhere now. I got the ad-supported version and it doesn't affect my experience. Battery life is incredible.

    I purchased this Kindle on a whim and was mostly curious about how it felt to read on an e-ink display since I had heard so much praise regarding it. Prior to this, I regularly used my iPad or iPhone to read, the iPad being much more convenient due to its large size. I don't think I ever really felt any eye strain using those, but the Kindle has undoubtedly been the most comfortable to use by far. I've used it at night with all the lights off and it still feels comfortable to use -- I didn't feel like I had to squint due to its brightness -- and I've also used it under direct sunlight, where it felt just as natural as reading on paper. I definitely did not expect myself to enjoy reading on a Kindle this much, but after trying it, I can confidently say that if given the choice, I wouldn't go back.

    This is an initial impressions review. I‚Äôll come back to update if opinions change.The Kindle arrived within a day which is appreciated. I got a Kindle because I‚Äôve been reading on my iPad through the Kindle app and was looking to consolidate. The iPad was used only for reading and I didn‚Äôt need it for anything else. The Kindle lags compared to the iPad. I‚Äôve also had it freeze on me a couple of times. A couple of time in 24 hours is not promising!  I like that the Kindle is compact and light. Easy to throw in my purse and take anywhere. I also like that you can read it anywhere at any time of day even with all of the lights off. I fully charged the device the day I received it (yesterday) and today it is down to 90% battery life. I have been downloading and playing with the features so maybe that is why but at this rate it will not last 10 weeks on a single charge as advertised. I thought it was a bit cheap of Amazon not to include a wall plug for the charger cable. I have some Apple wall chargers flying around and those seem to work fine, but if you don‚Äôt, this aspect might be annoying to you. It takes a little while to figure out how to navigate around because there are literally no instructions. That‚Äôs fine for me, I don‚Äôt read instructions, but keep this in mind if you are gifting this to someone that is not tech savvy. I had to Google how to get back to my home page after reading my book because I just could not figure it out (tap the top of the Kindle screen for options). I like that you can browse the Kindle store directly from the device and make purchases. I don‚Äôt think I was able to do that on the Kindle app on my iPad. Am I still glad I bought a Kindle?  I think so. Time will tell if the freezing issues and lag time when scrolling cause too much frustration.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My old Kindle started acting a bit wonky, so Amazon Prime day came along and I thought it might be a good time to get a new one.  I love the new Kindle.  It's a little larger and faster and the battery life is impressive.  I like that it uses the newer 'C' type charging cables, so now all my devices use the same cables.  The only thing I don't like about this new version is how my books are originally organized.  I'm hoping that I can organize them differently.  Just haven't gotten to it yet.  Plus, how the books are listed has changed.  Rather than just the title and author, there's a picture of the book itself.  Again, perhaps this can be changed.  I need to look.  Other than these minor annoyances, I love the new Kindle.

    The Paperwhite I have been waiting for
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Kindle Paperwhites don't get updated very often, and each of the previous two models (2015 and 2018) have been only SLIGHTLY improved from their predecessors.  This has been frustrating, because the underlying technology has improved, and I've felt the Kindle could be so much better.  But Amazon has little competition in the e-ink e-reader market (the Kindle's market share is around 75%, the other 25% is all other brands combined), so Amazon has little incentive to pack the latest tech into their devices.But the 2021 Paperwhite is a big leap forward, compared to the 2015 and 2018 models.  The biggest improvement is the screen quality:  sharp, dark text and the ability to adjust the warmth of the background  makes it look much more like paper than ever before.  This significantly improves the reading experience, and eye comfort.Second is the size of the display, which is now 6.8"" diagonally compared to 6.0"" for previous models, which makes it taller and wider.  The difference between the new & old screen size is similar to the difference between a trade paperback (which is nearly the size of the hardcover version, without the hard cover) and a mass market paperback (which is significantly smaller than the hardcover version, with pages that are more cramped with text).Third is the size of the bezels around the display.  The bezels on the 2018 and earlier models look very chunky compared to the narrower bezels on the 2021 model, which are narrower yet still big enough that you can hold the Paperwhite without your fingers blocking the screen.  This change is cosmetic, and some people won't care about it.  But many people like the narrower bezels, and also it means that more of the device is screen so you're getting a bigger ratio of screen to overall size & weight.Speaking of that, the 2021 model is slightly bigger and very slightly heavier than the 2018 model.  I compared them side-by-side, and the differences were apparent.  But after using the new model for 15 minutes, I didn't care and haven't given it a thought since.I've now had my 2021 Paperwhite for 5 weeks and I've read 4 books on it.  I've definitely had a better experience with it than any previous Paperwhite model I've owned.  Even my wife, who normally has zero interest in updating her tech unless her old model stops working, ordered a 2021 Paperwhite once she saw how much better mine is compared to the previous gen Paperwhites we both have been using for years.When we bought ours, Amazon gave us each $28 in trade-in credit for our previous Paperwhites plus a $25 discount, so the net cost was around $90 + tax each.  Not bad!  Though if I had to pay full price, I happily would, knowing how much better the 2021 Paperwhite is.One last thing:  don't buy Amazon's leather cover for this new Paperwhite.  It's a big step down from the leather covers for the 2015 & 2018 models.  Read the user reviews, most people really dislike it.  On the other hand, Amazon's fabric cover is very nice, and there are third-party covers that are good to great and cost less than Amazon's own covers.Happy reading!

    Much better than previous paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This generation of paperwhite is much better than the previous one.  The screen is larger, but still small enough to fit in my back pocket.  I do miss the colors.  We have a few of these in the family and it was to have them in different colors.  The screen is somewhat sensitive and I find it unintentionally flips pages (forward or backwards).  However, these are minor inconveniences given the high quality product.

    This kindle does not hold a charge like the reviews indicated.  I had to recharge after less than week and get a message of an application error almost two times a week on machine.  You can click ""okay"" and it goes away.  If you buy this as a package and trade in your old kindle on the same order.  you don't get the 20% rebate only the $25 for the kindle trade in.  In order to get the 20% rebate. you have to place your order later by returning the Kindle you received and placing another order.  Returned and will buy again. Received word from Amazon that they are fixing the technical issues and to update next month.  Very impressed.

    Great device!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased the new Kindle Paperwhite last week during ‚ÄúPrime Day‚Äù; good price discount, got it for $88. The device is for my husband, he is an avid and voracious reader! I use my iPad to read ‚Äúkindle‚Äù books. My husband uses his iPhone ‚Äúkindle‚Äù app (the battery life is not good on iPhones, and reading books drains them even faster). So, we thought Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect solution. We were right!! Seemless integration with our library‚Äôs ‚ÄúLibby‚Äù app - books are delivered immediately to Kindle! Also, any books bought/borrowed (kindle unlimited) from Amazon is also immediately available on Kindle to read. We only have one account on Amazon, however our reading choices vastly differ. The library ‚Äúgrouping/collection ‚Äú option makes it super easy for my husband to access his books without having to scroll through my reading list. The screen is a perfect size, the device is very lightweight. He loves the screen brightness/intensity option too! Plus, the warm light option is great on the eyes for late night reading. Overall, he is very pleased with the device performance and happy I made the purchase.

    I had a Fire tablet that was slow and the Kindle app just does not do dark mode on it. The Kindle Paperwhite, however, does dark mode! I can read at night til I fall asleep without headaches. Before I would try to read and couldn't stand the light for more than 20mins. Now I am bumbling around finding all sorts of books. This has also prevented me from watching TV until I fall asleep. Now I read to fall asleep. This is SO light. I love that I could take this anywhere. I love real books, the smell of pages w/ink and all but when you already have a million things to travel with, this just simplifies it.Trade in your old Kindle/Fire tablet and get this one with Dark Mode and you'll find yourself reading more.

    Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) ‚Äì Now with a 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light ‚Äì Ad-Supported
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased my first Amazon Kindle Paperwhite in this bundle deal. I did not need the extra charging block but it's essentially free when purchased with the bundle, so why not?This is my first experience with any Amazon Kindle. I have recently taken up reading again and was beginning to accumulate a collection of physical books so I opted to go paperless instead. I chose this Kindle Paperwhite (8 GB) with 6.8"" display and adjustable warm light, Ad-Supported; along with the Kindle Paperwhite Fabric Cover (11th Generation-2021) in Deep Sea Blue.I read in the evenings while laying in bed with my head and shoulders slightly propped up on a pillow. I have the brightness turned all the way down on the Kindle and the adjustable warm light to almost as ""yellow"" as it will go. I also wear blue-light blocking glasses. I have NOT noticed any negative impacts on my eyes or sleep schedule due to the light from reading on this Kindle. The overall Kindle and case together are very lightweight and easy to use. The Kindle screen automatically turns off/on when the case opens/closes. My hands, wrists, arms do not ache or get tired when reading for ~30+ minutes.The battery life so far is beyond exceptional. When I first received my Kindle, I fully charged it and set it aside for 2 MONTHS while I finished reading the remaining physical books I had already purchased. When I picked up the Kindle, after it had been sitting for 2 months, the battery was still at 80%.I am still learning the little tricks and settings within the Kindle as far as turning off page numbers, percent complete, estimated times, and overall page layout, font, size, etc. I am still toying with the highlighting and other reference/resource features. But overall, the functionality is very intuitive. I have NOT needed to Google any instructions on how to change something yet... I originally contemplated spending the extra money for the version without ads but decided against it, which now I would recommend. The Ads don't bother me at all and only seem to appear on the lock screen.I thought I would miss physical books and put off buying a Kindle for far too long. This Kindle is so much more convenient, light weight, travels easy, and you don't get distracted with notifications (as you might with a ""regular"" tablet). I would highly recommend a Kindle to any avid reader.

    So, to begin, I got my kindle as a Christmas present.  All was going well with that one until sometime in April when it crashed and it was constantly trying to reboot and restart.The customer service was awesome and sent me a replacement.  (Knock on wood) I haven‚Äôt had any issues with this new one and it‚Äôs July now.Overall, I love this thing, especially with a KU subscription.  It makes it easy to read, anywhere, at any time of day.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this is supposed to have up to 10 weeks of battery life, mine only lasts about 2-3 weeks if I‚Äôm reading exclusively on my kindle for long periods of time.  This doesn‚Äôt really bother me, but the 10 weeks sounds more like a standby charge and not a use charge.I love that it‚Äôs got the option to make the screen tone an orange hue, which is ideal for night time reading.  It‚Äôs also waterproof so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it getting wet if I‚Äôm reading while taking a relaxing bath or lounging by the pool.Overall, this is an awesome device and it‚Äôs really helping my rewarding goal (I‚Äôm at 28/50 so far!)

    Not as good as my previous Kindle Voyage
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve read about 10 books on this Kindle and have come to this conclusion: the Kindle Paperwhite (PW) is a step down from my Kindle Voyage so I am returning it. If you‚Äôve never used the Voyage, then you will probably love the PW. It is easy to read and the operating system has some nice features that my Voyage does‚Äôt. The screen is a slightly larger which most users will see as an advantage. However, it seemed huge to me at first because I was used to a smaller screen.On the PW, you press the page on the right side to turn to the next page, and press it on the left side to return to the previous page. On the Voyage, you can press either side to move forward or backward, which is great if you hold the Kindle with your left had while reading, as I do. On the PW, when holding it with your left hand, you must tap the screen with your right hand or stretch your thumb across the screen to tap it.The response to tapping is still slow. As far as I can tell, there is no speed improvements since I bought my Voyager in 2016.One feature the new PW has is Audible integration. I‚Äôm an Audible junkie and enjoy the Whispersync technology. Sometimes I enjoy listening to a book while reading it on the Kindle. Unfortunately, if you use your PW to listen and want to read along, the PW ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù the words. It is very distracting and I could find no way to shut it off. Also, if you are listening while reading along, and you flip back a page to glance at something, the narration will jump to that page, which is frustrating. In addition, if you like to listen to Audible and 1.5x, the PW does a terrible job. All in all, I think it is best to avoid using this PW for audible.I purchased the bundle which included the case. The case is nothing to brag about. My Voyager case folds so the Kindle will be slightly slanted if you sit it on a table to read.Also, I see no reason to pay extra for additional memory. Kindle books take up very little memory and it is quick and easy to download them when you are connected to WiFi.If you‚Äôve never used a Kindle or only use to the low end Kindles, this is the Kindle for you. If you‚Äôre use to the Voyage, you will be disappointed.

    I very much enjoy reading and if i cant bring my real books everywhere reading them electronically without ""being on my phone"" is great. I feel like touch screen has a slight delay compared to my smart phone but its tolerable. I was a bit bummed that its completely colorless, meaning the book covers in the library are in black n white and the ""highlights"" aren't in color like the app. Switching from the app to the Kindle is a little bit to get used to because u change pages differently. Instead of swiping u have to tap right to go ahead and left to go back and tap top to get tbe menu. I wish there was an option to have it the same as the app.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've owned Kindle e-readers since they first came out in 2007 and have lost count of how many models I've owned but all have been great.I read a lot, probably 20 or more hours a week, almost all on Kindle. The current 2021,11th generation, is by far the best I've used.The larger display makes a real difference and the touchscreen sensitivity and faster page turns are the most important differences to me but there are many other significant upgrades.It's absolutely worth buying at full price. However, I bought mine on Prime Day and traded in my 7th generation model. With the Prime Day discount, trade-in, etc., it cost less than $50 for the upgrade and I'm delighted.I've attached a side by side photo of the new 11th generation and my old 6th generation model. It's a huge improvement.

    I read in bed at night. You can adjust brightness (warmth) so you don't bother someone else trying to sleep & you can schedule when to switch from cool to warm and the warmth saturation itself.  I still find the controls  & scrolling a little clunky e. g. looking through library & I think I'm going to attach one of those phone knobs on the back so it's easier to hold to read. It's a little wide & slippery for my small hands. It's great for reading outside. I wish you could do the finger swipe (like I used to with Kindle app on my IPad) to turn pages instead of tapping on edge of screen. Update: it helps to read the user guide because it says I can swipe, & it gives more info on sorting libraries in ""family"" mode) It is too easy to skip pages if you are carrying it from one room to another so just switch it off. I do like when I can display the book I'm reading on front screen (ad free) but it's not really worth the extra $$ to get ad free option. The only ad you ever see is reading recommendations on your front screen when it's turned off. All in all it's a great product.

    this new kindle is replacing my old paperwhite from 2017. Love the dark mode. I use it in bed and fall asleep, so it goes into standby all night, so I wish it would power off after a set time to conserve battery even more. I don't like the way both paperwhites have to be powered off. You have to push and hold the button and wait for it to respond. It takes too long for me. I wish there were some kind of sliding switch that could be used for instant shutdown. Also, I wish there were more choices of oragami cases for sale. My first paperwhite kindle had lots of cases to choose from.  This kindle doesn't have as many choices and the pattern that I liked didn't work well because the magnets aren't strong enough to hold the stand in place.

    I had reservations about upgrading, and only did so because of the prime day deal and the trade-in offer.  I upgraded from the 2015 Paperwhite.  Due, partially to my previous/new case, the new, larger version is the same size in case.  Less than a millimeter on any side difference.  The screen is less grainy and slightly easier to read.  The battery life seems like it will last quite a bit longer.  Those would not have made the cost worth it.  What puts it over the top, the page transition and scrolling speed.  Changing pages on the new Paperwhite does seem truly instant.  Much faster to scroll through my library when I am not sure what I want to read next.  I turned off the ads with no issue.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Replaced an older version, with the page turn buttons along the edge.  This is ok, touchscreen, but have to be careful to not accidently touch the screen, like when reading in bed, and shift around.  Sometimes with an accidental touch there seems to be several pages turned or maybe a return to a chapter or some other location, and can take some searching to get back where I was.  And I will make the comment, at the total risk of having others tell me to RTFM...I have not found how to keep or change the footnote area that sometimes displays page number, or ""location"", or percentage read.  Seems to come and go and I have not found easily how to set this and keep it.  It would be nice to be able to return when I have mistakenly hit the screen and botched my reading.  Size is much better than previous, can actually carry in a pocket while not feeling near so restricted as trying to read on a stinking phone (letting my bias toward a phone being something other than a phone show through there, sorry.)  Big question...yes, I would buy again, but would prefer a model with physical buttons.  Battery life seems terrific, ample for even a longer camping outing.

    Finally back to reading digital books again
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I used to own the original version Kindle digital reader (a looong time ago). I enjoyed it but got away from reading digital books. Watching videos on YouTube and asking a coworker, I decided to try again since I've found that reading digital books on my iPad can be cumbersome because it is heavy and can cause eye strain.The Kindle Paperwhite is light, easy on the eyes, and much easier to use than its original version. The setup was really easy since I already have an Amazon Echo set up to my wifi, all I really had to do was turn it on and confirm that it goes with my Amazon account. It connected automatically to my wifi and I was all set up.I like that I can also read library books on the Kindle and that previous books I purchased were still there and available to read. Now, I might be able to catch up on my reading. Ha! I like the warm light setting and the page turn feature that makes it look like you are turning pages when you tap the screen to advance to the next page.I do hope that Amazon adds more fonts in the future, like the new ""bionic"" font that helps you read and supposedly retain more of what you read.

    My 2nd Kindle and a definite upgrade!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I got this Kindle during a special deal and have been enjoying the bigger screen surface, better touch options, more intuitive directions and design pretty much every morning and often in the evening. Don't know why I waited YEARS to get a Kindle. They are very handy. This Kindle's brightness is easily dialed down and a softer light prevails.

    Not enough options
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my Kindles, I have three. Two are the Paperwhites. This is the newer model and there's a couple things that seriously bother me. First is you can't set a screen timeout limit and second you can't stop the screen from locking once it starts to lock. I know it's the basic model but these should be standard options. I still love it though.

    Power button placement is annoying
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I just finished my first book on this new Kindle Paperwhite and I‚Äôm loving that I can go into my backyard and read it in full sun so clearly! However, I agree with many users who‚Äôve mentioned the power button at the bottom. Whoever came up with that design should be demoted. If you look at the way you hold any device then your pinky finger is probably propping up the bottom of it. If you‚Äôre right handed, that pinky finger hits right where the power button is. I‚Äôm constantly turning it off. I told myself, when reading other reviews on this issue, that I wouldn‚Äôt do that and bought it because it was Prime Day. Ugh! I‚Äôm annoyed every ten minutes because I ALWAYS do it. Taking away one star for this design flaw.

    This generation provides a much more responsive experience (power on/off, page turn, browsing in general), and the increase in screen size makes it a modern-looking device and the improve in reading experience is significant. Highly recommend to own or to upgrade!

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I am  having a bit of buyer's remorse with this.  I had been thinking of getting a new Kindle just because mine was old but then I started having connection problems. I was on chat & the phone for HOURS & no one could figure out what the problem was. Finally I was told it was just old, it hadn't even updated in nearly a year, & I probably should just get a new one which I did since I'd been thinking about it anyway.  When it arrived it wouldn't connect either.  I brought them both to the library &  both connected.  It turned out it was something weird w/ my ISP  not the Kindle at all.  But I decided to keep the new one & gave the old one away.  Now I wish I hadn't.  This one is a bit bigger,  is more square & feels a bit awkward to hold since I don't want to bend  back the cover like I did on my old one which cracked it along the fold.  I wish the settings we could choose from were all in one place rather than scattered around. I am not real tech savvy & think they are hard to find.  I don't care what other people highlight in books & I for sure don't know why anything is highlighted in a novel but I looked all over & couldn't find how to turn that off.  I contacted chat & they eventually told me it was on the font Aa page under 'more'.  I have trouble getting to the things I want & don't know  how to get back to a page.  I just got a new book & it didn't even go to the Kindle even tho that's what I selected.  I had to get it from my  Amazon page w/ all my books on it. The ones that were new on the  old Kindle are not labeled as such on that page so  now I don't know what I haven't read & what have only been removed from the device. I get books on special offer so sometimes I have them quite a while before I get to them. I really hate that warm, amber light!  I turned it on accidentally then it took a bit to find out to turn it off but I was able to lower it to zero so that shouldn't be a problem any more.  I suppose it's just a matter of getting used to where things are, like learning a new comp,  but that isn't a pleasant process. I do think it could be a little more user friendly for those of us who are technologically challenged.  I also wish there was a general tech support category for chat.  I've had to click on something that didn't apply to get help but everyone I have talked to has been fantastic.  I hope I cheer up about it now that I have it but right now I really miss my old one.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My husband gave me my first Kindle Keyboard over 10 years ago.  I LOVED IT!  When I started getting the notices about the changes and what it would no longer be able to do I said OK, time to upgrade.  After comparing and reading reviews I decided to get the Paperwhite.  I do like the touchscreen and the built in light. Its easy to read. BUT I DO NOT LIKE how it has the library!! Its too hard to navigate, my ""READ"" books take up space. It was so easy to look at the unread books list on my old Kindle and move my read books to collections.  Not so much with the Paperwhite.  That is my biggest complaint with the device.  If they could change it to look like the old Kindle, I would be a happy camper.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My husband has always been the avid reader in the family. I had always been to busy to get caught up in it....but for some reason, I kept getting lured in to making this purchase. It felt a bit frivious to me at first to make this purchase, since I never really read that much. My husband kept pointing out....I could use my tablet to read......but for some reason I was really drawn to the idea of owning a Kindle Paperwhite. At Christmas, I received a gift card and I thought, ""Ok, now is my time to take the plunge and make this purchase."" I made the purchase and have not regretted it one bit. I have become a reading addict in these few short months. I have flown through about 30 books so far. I love my Kindle Paperwhite so much, that I don't even pick up my tablet anymore.  I no longer waste my free time playing mindless games or watchin videos on my tablet, I just want to read the next great find on my Kindle. I LOVE the antiglare screen of the Kindle. Before I purchased this, I was afraid that I would not like the smaller size of the screen, but honestly, since owning the device it has not been a concern. The battery life is amazing. Easy to navigate. Lighter to hold and prop up when reading in bed. The glow of the screen makes it easy to read in the dark, but doesn't emit the blue light that interrupts sleep cycles. Purchasing the Kindle Paperwhite has brought me so much joy. It was definitely one of my best purchases. If you are on the fence and trying to rationalize that you don't need to spend the money because you have a tablet that you can use, just take the leap. I am glad that I did. I definitely prefer reading on it versus another device!

    I absolutely love this latest Paperwhite. The bigger screen offers a seamlessly pleasant experience, with the Sepia setting my favorite, as I find it the most pleasant in the eyes.But the feature that has me the happiest is the battery life. I received it nearly an entire month ago, and have purposefully not charged it past the first 100% which I did it the very first day, and after reading quite a bit every single day I've had it, and it's still at 9%!!!Outstanding!!!

    My wife is a voracious reader, which is why she has been a Kindle fan since they first came out (remember the QWERTY pushbutton days?).  The battery had really gone down after years of use on her older version (maybe bought 5-6 years ago), and it was time for an upgrade.  This version, despite a much bigger screen, is MUCH lighter, which is great for her as she often reads before bedtime.I bought it on sale for $98, and she's thrilled.  Of course, that makes me a happy hubby.

    I had to buy a Bluetooth speaker for read aloud when I‚Äôm cleaning or busy doing something else since it has no speaker built in. Kindle messed up leaving off this feature. Luckily I also have an old paper white that has speaker. Scared it will die or I will drop it!  This is my back up. Over almost twelve years I have become attached to read aloud with six Kindles. They don‚Äôt like being dropped on the floor without a cover!  I know can understand Microsoft mispronunciation!

    I prefer the Kobo Clara HD
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Love:-Temperature adjustment (although this is also available on the Kobo Clara HD)-I can send most titles from Libby to Kindle from my multiple library accounts, although it takes an extra step-Dark mode - most comfortable for reading in‚Ä¶darknessDislikes:-I miss the bezeled screen. It‚Äôs too easy to accidentally turn a page.-The screen feels harder to read on than the Clara HD. It seems less matte and requires more eye-straining illumination to read comfortably in the same light as the Clara HD.-I wish it were smaller. The Clara HD is the perfect size for me and my small hands. Add a flip cover to the Paperwhite and it feels just a bit too unwieldy, heavy, and unbalanced in my hand. I thus prefer reading it ‚Äúnaked,‚Äù with a clip on grip, but that requires a larger travel sleeve that is significantly less compact than the Clara HD, which literally fits my jacket or rear pants pocket.-Ads. Every time I look at them when I go to pick it up, I am filled with disgust. I am unfortunately even more indignant about *paying* to remove that feeling, so here I am.-Fingerprints. Ew. I am not a dirty person and I swear I wash my hands frequently, but you wouldn‚Äôt think that by looking at my Kindle. If it came in white, it would probably be significantly less noticeable.-Lack of font options. I know I can sideload more, but why must I have to do it to get any kind of variety?If I could get the Clara HD to sync both my library cards on my overdrive account at the same time, I‚Äôd be using that instead of the Paperwhite. It‚Äôs a significantly better value for your money, more pocketable, more pleasurable to read on and handle, faster, and if you like free books, easier to use with a  *single* library account (in the US). The moment Kobo streamlines Overdrive and you can have more than one library to toggle between, I will definitely be saying goodbye to Kindle, as I own very, very few Kindle titles and borrow most of my books. If you‚Äôre already heavily invested in Kindle‚Äôs ecosystem, I am truly sorry.

    Great device, poor quality control (dead pixel)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I wish I could give the 6.8‚Äù Kindle Paperwhite (11th gen 2021) 5 stars. It‚Äôs a beautiful, snappy device with a bright, clear large screen. Unfortunately, poor quality control makes this almost perfect device, not so perfect.Purchased: 27 November 2021Review written: 30 November 20211. ResponsivenessScreen is very responsive and snappy. There‚Äôs not much load time when scrolling, selecting, or page turning.2. SoftwareNice user interface. Very easy to use, especially to transfer over library books. There were some issues when opened out of the box, but a reset fixed the issues.3. Battery/chargeUSB-C may be a winner for some. I have no opinion.4. Quality ControlKindle is known for having hit or miss quality control. The new 2021 Paperwhite is no different. For me, my Paperwhite has tiny pinhole light also known as a dead pixel. E-readers are prone to this issue so it‚Äôs not a surprise, BUT a defect is a defect regardless. Quality control should have found this issue so it doesn‚Äôt fall into the hands of customers.The pinhole is negligible but it is annoying when my eyes stray towards the small light hole. Plus, I paid for a defect-free new device.5. Amazon Customer ServiceAmazon online CS used to be unparallel, second to none. I contacted Amazon online CS about the pinhole light and I was willing to send pictures of the issue. I expected to be sent a new replacement device. Some unlucky customers have to go through 2-3 devices before they find a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù device free of defects/issues. I went into buying the Kindle knowing this.The best Amazon online CS could offer was to replace my defected device with a certified refurbished device delivered 2-3 days. I asked if a new device could be sent out, CS said no. I asked if I could exchange for another device in store, Amazon CS said no.I called the Amazon store and the supervisor told me that I can return my device and buy a new device. They will do a price adjustment for me so I pay the same price as I did during Thanksgiving weekend. That was a nice offer‚Ä¶ except it makes the process for a new device inconvenient.Anyhoo, approach Kindle with some caution. It‚Äôs not a flawless device. It has the potential to be, though. I‚Äôm going to try to ignore the dead pixel as I read before I get a chance to return it for a (hopefully) defect free device.UPDATED REVIEW - January 6, 2022I returned the defective Kindle unit at the Amazon 4Star and purchased a new Kindle unit. The Amazon employee did a price adjustment for me so it matched sale price from my original purchase. Right from the box, the new Kindle unit has a very small black dot at the top right of the screen - very minor cosmetic issue.  Another dead pixel. This defect is not noticeable compare to the white light  spot (pinhole light/dead pixel(s) as the returned Kindle unit.I expected this. A few lucky Kindle users get Kindles with flawless screens. Some customers have to return/exchange 3-4x to get a perfect unit. Since the cosmetic issue is so minuscule, I accept it. The new unit has an almost perfect screen.Customer service at the Amazon 4Star store is above average.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Much has been said about the Paperwhite, here‚Äôs my two cents:Positives: backlight works great, warmth option is really nice, adjustable brightness is fantastic, very lightweight, easy to hold.Negatives: the computer processor is very slow, which is crazy for a modern device of any kind. Browsing for books is so slow and the screen takes a long time to refresh. Best to browse on Amazon.com directly and buy books from there, don‚Äôt bother doing it on the Kindle itself unless you have hours to do it. This is absolutely NOT a replacement for an iPad or tablet - not even close.Overall: Reading is GREAT. Web browsing is very bad. Backlight and warmth options are excellent. Worth the buy but you will need to have your laptop or phone nearby to complete any tasks except reading a book. Fair trade on that issue given the low price and extensive Amazon book catalog.

    I always love the Kindle E-readers and this is about my sixth one. However, I noticed the charging port is not the standard one but requires  the charging cable that comes with the Kindle or an adapter for a standard cable. Why? Now if I travel I have to bring along a special cable to charge my Kindle instead of one that charges everything. Also the on/off button would work better on the top of the Kindle because when I rest the Kindle on my legs it sometimes turns it off.

I like the 2 different light adjustments, it makes it nice when reading at night and you don't want the bright white light.  I do also like the slightly larger screen size.

    Had been wanting a kindle for some time now, took the plunge on prime day & I'll never look back. It's annoying that you can't purchase books through the app any longer but that's more of a first world problem really. Battery lasts a long time. Perfect size for tossing in your bag.

    I really enjoy this Kindle with the adjustable bright backlight! I use to have an old kindle that I used at night with another clip on light. The light would keep me up at night. If you were considering upgrading your old kindle, this is the one to buy!

    i stopped reading for a while bc the only time i ever really have is at night , but my boyfriend will be asleep and not want the lights on so this is the perfect compromise . plus if we go somewhere at night i can read without the light bothering him , unlike with my paperbacks .my only critic is that it's kinda slow when i'm on the homepage or making comments/highlighting within books which i wouldn't expect from a brand new device but maybe that's just kindle ? it's perfect when actually reading so i'm not too bothered by it .

    My mom has an older Kindle Fire that she loves, but she had mentioned that she didn't like that she had to have a light on to read at night.  In comes the Paperwhite; since it's backlighted no light is needed to read!  It also has better battery life than her other Kindle and she loves the slim silhouette!  Perfect birthday present.

    Bigger Screen, Better Battery Life
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Background:  Prior to this model, I was using the Kindle Oasis which had a terrible battery life. I much prefer the Kindle Oasis form factor, however just 1 year of use, the batter life issue became a major hinderance. I was having to recharge once or twice a day! I read using my Kindle for hours daily and I was not expecting to have such battery issues! After a year with such terrible battery performance, AND seeing the new Kindle Paperwhite came with updated USB-C, I decided it was worth it to purchase the new model.Pros:The Battery Life is improved over my Kindle Oasis - like a HUGE change for the better. I can go days without charging! Also, USB-C charging is so much better than micro!Screen: I like the size of the screen and appreciate the addition of the warmth setting! The backlighting is also excellent.Cons:Form Factor: My preference is for the Oasis - having two page-turning buttons. Also, it just felt good to hold. This model Kindle Paperwhite does not fit in my hand as well as the Oasis did. I dislike how the screen is not centered, the margin below the screen, with the KINDLE branding makes this device feel off-balance.I hope to someday come back to the Kindle Oasis, until then, the Kindle Paperwhite is an excellent e-reader for most readers with a long-lasting battery and other additions that make reading an absorbing experience.

    Surprised How Much I Like this Reader!!!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    When I saw the size (small) I did not think I would like this reader, but was intent on giving it a few weeks before returning...but the surprise is I actually LOVE this reader!  Have grown accustomed to the compact size, well lit, nice font sizing, and screen touch is acceptable.  Overall, a quality reader at not a lot of money.Still not sold on the Amazon additional service ($10/month for unlimited books), finding that most of the books I want to read are not included in the collection, and likely will end up having to buy Kindle version for download.Also, the covers they pair with the reader are way overpriced.  The cork one was a bust.  Found one made by OOC and LOVED it, at $17.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My previous Kindle Paperwhite was only holding a charge for a few days and it was looking kind of beat up, so I decided it was time to upgrade. Here are the pros and cons compared to the previous model:Pros:* Lightweight* Larger screen* Better screen: the older model had dark areas at the top and bottom of the screen* No stuck pixels: the older model had three stuck pixels that bugged me* Waterproof (I could care less about this)Cons:* The wider form factor makes it more difficult to hold, especially if you have small hands* The border is now part of the screen, so if you touch it, it will leave smudges* Because the border is part of the screen, if you touch the left or right border, it will take you back or forward a page. This is the worst thing about this Kindle. I often find myself on the wrong page because I touched the border. I'll have to train myself to keep my fingers off the front of the device. Whether I'll be successful remains to be seen.Bottom line: I like this Kindle Paperwhite. I would like it more if the designers had made it so touching the black border didn't turn the page. Keep a microfiber cloth handy and try not to touch the border and you'll be ok.

    Have only been using a week, but so far, so good. The warm light definitely takes some getting used to, but easily adjustable. Love the larger screen, but as others have said, it is easier to accidentally advance the page due to the slimmer bezel.  I purchased to replace a 2014 model (yes, 2014 that had only recently started acting a bit sluggish) and looking forward to another several years of enjoyment.  You will definitely need to purchase a cover (it's a bit slippery without) and honestly, the open to wake feature is awesome!

    his is my first kindle and I love it! The optimal size, it is convenient to take with you in your bag, it is convenient to read at home. Intuitive interface. My friend scared me that I would not be able to download books through the computer. All this is fiction. Very convenient, I copied my files, like on a USB flash drive. The process takes a couple of minutes. I also really love this particular model for waterproof, I take it with me to the bath and I don‚Äôt worry that I will drop it into the water. The battery with WiFi turned off lasts about a month. When buying, I misunderstood the functionality of audible, I thought that the robot would read books aloud to me. Well, you never know how technology has evolved. Of course, I was wrong. But this in no way prevents me from sincerely loving my kindle üòä

YES, you can read libby ""rented"" books, you just have to ""rent"" them through your phone or iPad first and then click ""read with kindle app."" It will transfer right away! The only thing I was not prepared for and really dislike is the ""glitching/twitching"" of the screen when you go to the next page or to the menu. I understand now that this is just how it works but I was not prepared for it in anyway and thought it came broken!

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The Paperwhite was easy to set up and once I remembered to tap the screen to get the home/settings icons to appear at the top, I was fine (and no longer got stuck on certain screens).I like the font setting, the adjustable brightness, and the warm-light option. I also like the light weight when compared to my prior Kindle (a much, much older model).I've had it for seven weeks now and charged it once only because I wanted to test the adapter. Charged it at 60-some percent maybe over a month ago and it still has 55% now (I don't use it daily). There's no problem reading on it while it is charging.Very happy with this product.

    Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen.- was a welcome upgrade over 10th Gen. ... but I had to try it to be convinced...Here's what I like:- e-Ink screen still best in sunlight, outdoor reading- screen is noticeably larger than last 10th gen. device c.2019- about 1/4"" higher and wider, but still fits in jeans pockets - carry anywhere!- new backlight option includes variable warm tone- waterproof- light weight - 200 grams - easier to hold for long reading sessions- added USB-C charge connection (finally, last of my devices to drop micro-USB)- overall noticeably faster - screen changes, swipes and on-screen keyboard typing- same $139 price-point for 8GB (plenty of space)- On device shopping and purchasing of eBooks (can't do on iPad App)- hands-down best choice for outdoor reading - see photo- battery life is excellent, can even be a solar powered Kindle with this 14watt panel - see photoSame design challenges that still needs work...- audio through Bluetooth, connecting and getting screen reader to speak is WAY too many taps (software changes needed! - PLEASE!)- wish power button was on the TOP edge, not the bottom edge - or make it recessed - often setting device down turns off- could still be a tiny bit faster, but this is first one that speed is acceptableOverall a great eReader that keeps getting better!

    Big improvement over my Kindle Voyage
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I fell for the hype of buying the ""premium"" Kindle Voyage when it was first released.  Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome Kindle but was quickly outclassed by the Kindle Oasis and the new, at the time, Kindle Paperwhite.  Anyway, I love my Voyage but when I heard about the new Kindle with the bigger screen, I had to have it.  It arrived yesterday and I'm really liking it.First, the things I don't like.- The Kindle arrived in a soft bubble shipping bag and the Kindle itself comes in a very thin, and for me, crushed, cardboard box.  I was afraid the screen was going to be broken but luckily for me, it was fine.- I don't like the power button being on the bottom.  The Voyage has the power button on the back and out of the way.  I've pressed the power button on the Paperwhite twice now by accident.- Another thing I don't like...and don't understand...is that I charged the Paperwhite overnight and it only charged to 99%.  My Kindle Voyage will only charge to 98%, even when it was brand new.  Is that a thing with Kindles; they don't charge to 100%?- The Paperwhite was supposed to arrive already tied to my account but it wasn't.  It wasn't hard to set up but it didn't transfer my library to the Paperwhite automatically.  Should it have?  From my PC, I transferred my library to the Paperwhite from the Digital Content management page.  That was a pain in the butt because you can only transfer the books 1 page at a time and my library is 34 pages long.  And you can't sort the books by whether they had been read or not, so I had to uncheck all the books I had already read so they wouldn't be transferred to the Paperwhite. Not to mention that not all of my read books were listed as being read so I had to sort that out too.  It took a long time to transfer my library. Ugh!Second, the things I do like.- Everything else!!- I love the larger screen. The extra screen real estate, compared to my Voyage, is awesome.- The Paperwhite is a lot faster than the Voyage in navigation, page turns, everything.- I'm glad it has a USB-C port, which will cut down on the number of cables I have to keep track of.- So far, I don't miss the physical buttons that the Voyage has...but I've only had the Paperwhite for a day so that may change with more use.I haven't played around with the lighting yet so I can't speak to that.My new Paperwhite got 2 software updates yesterday.  After the second one it froze and I had to restart it.  After that it was fine.So far, I'm really pleased with the new 2021 Paperwhite and I think it is a great upgrade from my Voyage.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had two kindles in my whole life and had to give them up, but I've been looking to get a Kindle for a while. I haven't had the funds to get one and have been content with my phone, until I upgraded phones and was forced to borrow books from KU by computer only.I chatted with Amazon Kindle support for a solution, so I could borrow books on my phone, but it seemed there was no solution. I didn't have my previous phone, so I couldn't just revert back to that. I tried multiple times to borrow a book, and it would say I borrowed it, but wouldn't show up in my library. Weeks after my chat with Amazon support, I heard there was a Kindle sale, so I bought the latest Paperwhite in hopes I would have access to KU.I ordered the 8gb version, and was excited to finally have a Kindle again. I received the device a week earlier than expected and immediately after set up, there wereproblems left and right. Right away, the device was continuously freezing and glitching. As I was trying to download books, it was deciding to restart itself for a total of three times and reset my download progress each time. Over the course of three days, I finally got all my books downloaded, but yet the device was still freezing and restarting itself.One day, though, the Kindle was close to being dead, so I decided to preserve the battery and not read until I could get it charged. After putting it on the charger, I went to read and it immediately froze.. again. This time, I couldn't do anything with it. It wasn't dead when I put it on the charger, it was working just fine before, but nothing was happening. I was trying to power it off and on, but it still wasn't working. I Googled the problem and came across directions for a soft restart, which I did. Upon restart, it wouldn't get past the kid and the tree screen, no matter what I did. Eventually I just gave up and left it there for an hour on that screen. It finally got past it, but the device was still glitching and freezing continuously three days later.Besides those problems, I'm also not impressed with the battery life. After a day of reading with it being fully charged, it drops to 20-30% remaining. It defeats the purpose of having a Kindle, when it has to remain on the charger at all times. Recently it's been more so on the charger than not.With the amount of problems I've been having, it's strange there's not much out there about them. This is a brand new Kindle, but with the amount of problems I've been having, you'd think it'd be the first generation. I don't know what to do with it. I want a Kindle so I can finally use my KU, but is the multiple problems worth it? I've been thinking a lot about possibly returning it and trying the signature edition, but what if it's the exact same? I don't know what to do. I'm not at all satisfied with this generation and I'm hoping something will change, like an update and it'll be usable again, but that might be too much to hope for at this point.

    This is my third Paperwhite and I honestly exited it to be better than my old on. It freezes up - a lot, easily as much as my first one does today and I bought that one in 2014.  I do love that when you put something in a collection it no longer shows in the main library.  I wasn‚Äôt offered a trade in when I ordered it so I paid full price.  What a piece of crap.  You read along and suddenly it goes forward a couple of pages, yesterday it would not let me go back.

    From 10th Generation to 11th Generation
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I recently upgraded from the 10th Gen Kindle Paperwhite to the 11th Gen Kindle Paperwhite and the difference is pretty noticeable, though there are still areas for improvement.For the most part, reviewing the Kindle for my purposes is pretty much the same as reviewing the function of a physical book. Is it damaged? No. Can it be easily read? Yes. Ok, then it's good to go.In truth, that's really the two most important things for me when deciding whether or not the Kindle was a good buy, and frankly, I could have stuck with my old Kindle and probably only very seldom got frustrated with it.One thing I believe Amazon needs to work on with their Kindle is their UI. I understand that this is not a cell phone, a laptop, or a tablet. It's an e-reader, and at the end of the day, most of your time is spent reading books. And for that, the UI is totally fine. But for those times when you're scrolling the store, looking through your library of too many books purchased, or just navigating settings, the UI can be frustratingly laggy and jumpy. The response time is slow, the touchscreen is relatively inconsistent, and the loading time looks like my dial-up computer trying to bring up a black and white webpage in 1998. Again- it's an e-reader and I'm not online shopping on it, but I have to feel that in 2022, this UI could be much smoother and more responsive.With that said, this is leaps and bounds better than my 10th Gen, which would regularly revert back to the previous screen when trying to load a new one, would flash a new screen 2-3 times before finally allowing me to continue navigating, and would shut down to the main screen intermittently. None of these were deal-breakers, but the 11th Gen is definitely smoother in that regard.Overall, I love this device. The larger screen from the 10th Gen to the 11th Gen is nice and it doesn't came with a significantly larger package. It's sleek and the screen is a nice adjustable shade when I read. I am very pleased with my purchase.

    Why doesn‚Äôt Amazon sell its own Kindle charging cord?
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve had a Kindle since the second version came out.  I thought I‚Äôd hate e-readers and refused to buy one until I was on vacation and went through all of the books I‚Äôd brought with half my trip left.  So I ordered one and it was delivered the next day.  I love them.When my Kindle Voyager (purchased in 2015) finally died, I was happy to get the new one largely due to the water resistant feature.  My prior Kindles have all survived accidental drops in the bath tub, but having one that is designed for it is a relief.This is my best Kindle yet.  The warm screen feature that allows me to set automatic changes based on my local sunrise and sunset is great.  The screen is even more clear.  It weighs less and without measuring it, I think the screen is slightly larger.  The basic memory is larger than my old one and I wasn‚Äôt even close to using all of that up with the over 1,500 books that I own on it.  I remain a devoted Kindle fan.My one complaint - the new charging cord is different than the old one.  Fine, no big deal.  I went online to order extra ones since I keep spares in my luggage, briefcase, etc.  (I pretty much don‚Äôt leave home without my Kindle.)  The third-party  cords that pop up on Amazon have largely poor reviews.  Which begs the question - why can‚Äôt I buy the exact cord that Amazon sent along with my new Kindle from Amazon?  They are having them manufactured.  Everyone needs more than one charging cord for their devices.  Amazon makes the wall plug in available, but not the cord.Come on, this seems like an easy fix.

    I loved this kindle.  I got it as a gift for this past Christmas.  My teething puppy chewed it up soooo bad and now it doesn't work, and it left a gaping hole in my heart.  EVERYTHING about this kindle i loved, coming from a nook which are laughable in comparison.  The speed was snappy, it never really got hung up no matter how many books i had on there, even side loaded ones.  The warm light was literally life when reading in bed at night.  It predicts how long it will take you to finish your current chapter which was also awesome.I wish so bad she didnt do it, but alas.  I am now stuck in sans-kindle land and i couldn't be more......sad.  For now, back to just reading on my ipad and shredding my eyeballs while doing it *sigh*

    Don‚Äôt laugh at me, but I just upgraded from the Kindle keyboard that I bought back in 2010. It still works perfectly and I love it, but it‚Äôs not backlit and I‚Äôm tired of the grey screen. I had the option of trading it in, but I‚Äôm keeping it as a backup.Anyway, I received my new Kindle yesterday and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs absolutely perfect! The size, the white screen, the back light; it‚Äôs all perfect. I bought the leather case as well and am pleased with it too. If this new Kindle Paperwhite lasts as long as my Kindle Keyboard, we‚Äôll be in business.

    I purchased the paperwhite after using my Galaxy tab to read but it was so heavy. I love that it is water proof so reading at the pool or bath isn't an issue if it gets wet. The light weight feel is perfect for reading. I wish I had bought one sooner.

    When you wake your book up you will have to swipe it to get to your library.Don't delete any books that you paid for because if you will have to pay for them again if you decide to reread them.The screen is bigger so you get more reading space for your buck.Enjoy everyone.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Before I got my Paperwhite, I read maybe one or two books a year. In the last two months since I bought my Paperwhite I have finished 18 books. I love that I can adjust the brightness to read in bed and not get a headache. I can read inside, outside, and haven't had any issue. I have had it just over two months and I have only put it on the charger it 4 times, and I read multiple hours a day. I haven't had to tested the waterproof feature yet. But having kids I'm thankful that that is an option.In the begining, first two weeks I did have a few issues where when I would try to load the store/ recommended books (to buy a book) the screen would go blank. After I did a hard reboot I had less issues. Then I had to do a hard reboot a second time a week later and haven't had any further issues with that feature.

    I am happy with Kindle.  Size is great.  The touch is very sensitive and sometimes turns more than one page but I think as I learn how much pressure to use it will get better.  Library is set up in more than one choice depending upon what you are looking for or which style you prefer.  Lighting can be adjusted.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.

    Better & Less Stable
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Definitely the best Kindle I've ever owned. The reading experience is much improved over my 2015 version. And Audible with Bluetooth rocks.One obvious downside though seems to be increased instability. It occasionally ignores touches, cannot connect, requires reboot, etc. Nothing terrible, but noticeable compared to the previous versions.

    Great Kindle with one annoying flaw
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my new Paperwhite - replaced a 5 year old Oasis whose battery was shot - great screen, size, etc... I like the larger screen on the Paperwhite than the Oasis, which was a bit small.Only one - very - annoying flaw. Apparently the screen can't be rotated on this version of the Paperwhite and the power button is on the bottom - and is very sensitive. So if you stand it on anything (for instance, a machine at the gym), the slightest jiggle will ""push"" the power button and cause the screen to reset. Super annoying - I've had to ""work around"" it by letting one side hang off the edge of the equipment.

    Great evolution in the Kindle lineup, but far from perfect.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought this a few days after they went on sale and overall I am very happy with the purchase.Screen Size: the upgrade in screen size is my favorite thing about this device, it makes reading much more pleasurable with fewer pages turns.I also love the waterproofing. My old Paperwhite did not have this and I love that I don't have to worry about it getting ruined at the pool, or more frequently, carrying to and from the car in a rainstorm.Is this a great device? Yes, it is a Kindle.Is this device perfect? Far from it...it's a Kindle. My main beef is the smaller bezel that every tech reviewer seems to go nuts about. I am constantly turning pages on accident because if you even imagine you're holding this thing with your thumb near the edge of the screen, the pages will turn. Amazon should add a feature that creates a user customizable dead zone on the edges so that accidental page turns are a thing of the past. This would rock my world. Or, you know, they could just make the bezels a little wider to make the device easier to handle.Another thing I cannot stand is the placement of the power button. Just resting the end of the device on a table and tilting it up is another to turn it off. This happens all the time. It also happens just holding the device...this power button would be better suited where it was on my older 2015 Paperwhite or, better yet, on top of the device, out of sight, out of mind.I am glad to see the direction they have taken this update. However, the OS is still laggy, the bezels and power button, due to the design, are FAR from optimal. I think they need to hand these out to employees during the design phase to do a LOT more testing before settling on the final design.But, who am I fooling? This device will sell like hotcakes so Amazon basically has no reason to listen to what any of us say. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but gave it 3 because these shortcomings do NOT make it a 4-star device.

    I've had a Kindle since the Keyboard/K3 was released. I've had the voyage and a 2nd generation Oasis but I keep coming back to the PaperWhite it might lack a couple features the Oasis has with but now with the upgrade to the larger screen it's now just . 2 tenths of an inch smaller than the far more expensive Oasis. I enjoyed my 2nd gen. Oasis but when battery began to fail I went right back to a PaperWhite. It has all I need at the right price. I love the larger screen. The battery life is impressive. The PaperWhite has always been the best deal in Kindles and now it's even better.

    Nice improvement, bad device, good support
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had an earlier generation paperwhite -- I really like that the Kindle generates its own light... no more leaving a light to read by.This gen 11 screen is much smoother than my old one, and the improved CPU does make it seem more responsive... I liked it in every way.... except for two things:1) Most important, after about six weeks, the device locked up, and could not be restarted or reset. On the good side, Amazon provided stellar support and is shipping me a replacement.2) I have many of my books in collections and the last update of the software is HORRIBLE! When I choose to view my collections, you have NO CHOICE but a grid view, and many of the books don't have easily readable titles... I want a list view, but this cannot be done!  If I just look at all of the books (no collection view), the form can be selected, but not once I tell it to show the collections. This is TERRIBLE!!!I hope that they fix this quickly, for I have to resort to searching to find my books now, since many of the covers are not that readable.But the Kindle operating system is not really the point of this review.  Bottom line is that the device is a nice improvement. Even with the failure after a few weeks, I still like it.

    I‚Äôm testing out this kindle against the Kobo Libra 2.What I like about the Kindle:+ screen is good size and clarity+ it is adequately snappy+ syncs across devices+ functional note and highlighting, easily shareable+ the nigh shift is greatWhat I don‚Äôt like about the Kindle- I‚Äôll frequently tap the screen somewhere and pull up the menu or turn a page, not immediately clear if it goes forward or backwards- not immediately clear how to access brightness- - the power button is on the bottom of the device. I have more than once accidentally locked the screen just by propping the device up. This is a fireable offense by the lead engineer who championed this location. A monkey would choose a better placement than the bottom of the device‚Ä¶.- - - YOU CANNOT, I REPEAT, YOU CANNOT ACCESS YOUR READING WISH LIST ON THE KINDLE. That‚Äôs right, you added a book to your wishlist in your app? PC? Even kindle? Awesome! Yeah but you won‚Äôt see that on your kindle. Literally adding a book on the kindle to a wishlist is INACCESSIBLE. You have to ‚Äúdownload a sample‚Äù or use ‚ÄúGoodreads‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry but this is absolutely inexcusable. You have the store built in but no way to access the wishlist. What‚Äôs the point? Embarrassing. I will most likely return the device over these two glaring issues.

    This is my first Kindle. In fact it is the first time that I've ever seen a Kindle aside from the ads.I have been using the Kindle app on my tablet. The app is great but my tablet is slow and uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time (arthritis).What I like:This device is light as a feather.It performs quickly.It is easy to read and customize.The ads are not intrusive at all. I hadn't intended to buy the ad supported device and didn't know that an ad free device is available. I can easily live with the ads and, who knows, Amazon might even display ads for books I might likeWhat I'm not crazy about:Page refreshes are kind of clumsy. Page turns are okay but the dialog boxes cause the screen to go dark for an instant when the box closes. To me this seems rough around the edges.The screen sort of reminds me of the old liquid crystal displays found on Palm Pilots and similar devices back in the day.I was hoping to find that the Kindle app and the actual Kindle have the same navigation. They don't.What I'm hoping for:Long battery life.  I do most of my reading at night so the backlighting will always be on. I'm still fiddling with the brightness setting to find a sweet spot.Set up was easy. I was happy to find that my library is complete without any complications.

    I upgraded from an older model. The clarity is nice but I wish the text was a true black instead of a grey. It's probably just something to do with the way e-books are but it would be nice to have the text darker. I ordered a screen protector for it and ended up having to take it off because it was obfuscating/dulling the text even more. There is not a way to darken the text of the Kindle Paperwhite, I think if you get the more expensive version there is the capability of modifying/darkening the text but at 160$, I feel like it should also be available.

    Overall, this is a good Kindle. I like the ""warm"" screen; easy on the eyes. The lock screen however is buggy. Entering the unlock code is slow because the Kindle is slow to respond to key presses. I've found the solution  is to restart/reset the Kindle and after it restarts, then the lock screen works better---for a while, then it starts to slow again. Battery life is good and recharge time is very fast.

    I had the previous generation Paperwhite and I currently have the 2+ year old Oasis and bought  the new Paperwhite for its new features.I'm really impressed with the 6.8 screen size which looks just as big as my 7 inch Oasis.  Love the warm light feature and thin body. The Paperwhite""s battery lasts weeks and outlasts my Oasis!! I've always been disappointed by the battery life of the Oasis.The new Paperwhite still has that portability Factor where I can just throw it in my jacket pocket and read anywhere. It has a zippy performance and seems to be faster than my Oasis. The USBC cable means you I can use the same plug as my phone. I don't like the old USB on the Oasis. I don't need the Paperwhite plus with the extra features. 'm not a big fan of the automatic sensor which I have on the Oasis, and I usually shut off. For most people the basic Paperwhite will be just fine for daily reading. The only thing negative I can say is that the paperwhite does not have page turning buttons like the Oasis, which is a nice feature to have but I don't always use them.My picture shows the Oasis on the left and the new Paperwhite on the right.Amazon, excellent job on the new Kindle Paperwhite!!! It's a winner in my book.

    One day, I'd really like to get a Kobo, just for fun. But every time that it's time for an upgrade, I keep coming back to Kindle. The 20% discount when you trade in your old Kindle certainly helps! Even  so, it's easy enough to convert epubs that I bought from elsewhere and put them on my Paperwhite, so that's never been a factor for me.I had the last generation Paperwhite, and I did like it a lot. I upgraded because I was interested in the bigger screen, faster page turns and usb-c charging.The 20% faster page turns doesn't really seem like that big of a deal to me over the previous generation. If you have a regular Kindle or an older Paperwhite, I think you'll really notice it, though. The screen wake doesn't seem any faster than my last  Paperwhite; I think that could still use some improvement.The bigger screen and usb-c charging were definitely worth upgrading for me, though.

    it might be operator error but so far I am not a huge fan.  I had a 2010 Kindle and I remember the day I bought it.  The Home page was MY Home page without all the extra ads for book options.  I had it organized by folders/collections and once I finished a book, it went in the folder.  Any book yet to read was listed below the collections.In this new Kindle, I created a 'Collection' and thought I moved read books to it but they are still on the 'Home' page which has TMI.  Yes, there is a banner in the upper right corner marked read but I don't want to see the book anymore.  I want it tucked away to the folder nice and neat and organized.I do like the warm lighting.  I can read on the patio when the darkness falls which is great.  I don't like having to position my finger to touch screen scroll to the next page and the chaos of the Home page is awful.  It should not be called a Home page.  It is advertising galore with book recommendations I would not consider.  I want my old Kindle Home page - if anyone who does updates is listening can do.  And what is with the check marks?  I have to do a search to understand that.  I really, really don't like this Kindle.  I want to put a new battery in my old Kindle and get on with life.  I also hate that I cannot put a password other than numbers.  Are the Kindle creators listening?  And once you finish a book, good luck getting to the 'Home' page without going all the way to the end of the book.  I tried doing the pull down at the top, yea, frustrating.

    Great experience so far with my first e-reader.Have had it for a 3 weeks now and am loving this little kindle. The battery life is extraordinary in my opinion;  I have only needed to charge it once. The screen is very comfortable on my sensitive eyes and I like that it's easily adjustable in both brightness and warmth. The size is perfect for me since I wanted something larger than a phone but smaller than a tablet to read on. Very lightweight and portable.Amazon gives you 3months free of Kindle Unlimited to access books. But I find I'm using OverDrive more often through the public library to rent ebooks which are sent straight to my kindle. Perfect for on the go readers because you don't need to be on wi-fi to access your library.

The only reason I don't give it give stars is because it sometimes feels a little slow, specially when waking up. I understand that it my be because of the ink like technology; also when you're coming from a 120Hz smartphone, everything else might feel slow.

    Everything is awesome about this kindle except how you hold it. The screen is clear and turns fast. Library integration is an INCREDIBLE value. Love the warm backlight and the USB-C connection. The only problem is that the bevel is thin and the touch screen extends too far toward the edge of the screen, so it's hard to hold.If the 'margin' option affected how far in the touch screen recognized taps for page turning, this would be an automatic 5 stars. As it is, still 4.5 stars--absolutely worth the money.

    I've owned about 5 Kindles over the years. This one is my favorite even over the newest Oasis because I like the shape better. A warm light is an essential feature for me after using the Oasis and the lighting on my PW is slightly more even than on my Oasis, even though the PW has less LED's. The screen clarity and sharpness look identical to me, so it really comes down to the shape since they fit about the same amount of text. Unless you really can't live without the page turn buttons, then the PW is probably the better option for most people. I thought I was one of those people who needed the physical buttons, but I don't miss them at all.I will say there is something I love about the Kindle basic with front light size wise. I still take that one out with me when I travel because it's a really great size, light, and very pocketable. I think my ideal device would be a Kindle basic with 300ppi, warm light, and shrunken bezels to fit say a 6.3-6.5 inch screen while keeping the physical dimensions the same. That would probably be my unicorn device. They could call it the Kindle plus and sell it for 120ish and would be a day one purchase for me.I predict the next Oasis will be 8-10 inches and have note taking capability with a stylus. There's not much of a reason to spend the extra money on the Oasis now that this newest PW is out. It's that good.

    I am discovering that not all Kindle books are compatible with the Kindle Paperwhite. I will probably be returning this and sticking to Apple books unless Amazon can resolve the problem for me. THIS IS AN ADDENDUM THE DAY AFTER I WROTE THIS REVIEW. For the first time ever, I got a call back from Amazon about my review and my unhappiness. Together, the Amazon rep and I looked at the book in question. If you scroll down a little on the book page, there is a drop-down menu that says ""available devices."" Clicking on that menu revealed that the book, indeed, is not available on my Kindle device, but is available on Kindle Fire, various Kindle apps, and cloud reader. I appreciated the callback and recommended that where books are not available on all Kindle devices, that is communicated in a more obvious way. I was impressed with Amazon's callback, but I can't go all the way to a 4 or 5-star review until I see that some changes have been made.

So I went back to Amazon and ordered the cable indicated for the Paperwhite 8GB and waited a week for it to arrive only to discover it is not compatible with the Kindle 8GB. It is not returnable, which is fine, but I have no one to contact at Amazon or the seller SMAYS to get the correct cable. Not a good way to do business. I‚Äôve been an Amazon customer for quite a while and have to say this is the most disappointing transaction ever.

    I chose this over libra 2, here's why
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had a first generation paperwhite, and this kindle has been a great upgrade overall. Definitely a lot faster, warm light and dark mode are great features, and USB-C is a huge plus for me. I've only had it for a few days so I can't comment on the battery life yet, so far so good. The only flaw I can find is that it doesn't stay connected to my school wifi, which is a little annoying.I was choosing between the kindle pw5 and kobo libra 2 and bought both devices to test them out. I am going to keep the pw5. Libra 2 is a great device, if I must say the better device. It also has overdrive support. In my case, I use my ereader almost solely for library books so this is a huge plus for me. However, kindle has all the features that I care about and was much cheaper, even though my trade-in promotions didn't come in time for black friday promotion due to some system error. I'm also not the biggest fan of the asymmetrical design of the libra 2 and couldn't care less for physical buttons, and the pw5 feels good in my hands since it's thinner and I can hold it with one hand without feeling like the other side is too heavy. On the other hand, the libra 2 definitely has better contrast and a nicer display. You won't really miss it though with the pw5, which has a great display as well.Overall, kobo's libra 2 is the better device and I would definitely recommend it over the signature edition. Compared to the regular pw5 though, the lower price of pw5 makes them about equal, and personally the pros of the libra 2 wasn't worth the extra 90 dollars and the cons of pw5 had easy workarounds for me.

    Marked improvement from 2018 version.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgraded via trade-in of my 2018 Paperwhite when the 2021 went on sale ($109) so I received a $30 credit for trade-in value and the 20% discount Amazon provides on top of the sale. I was hesitant at first to upgrade considering I just purchased the 2018 version in September 2021 right before new one was released, but I couldn't wait any longer. The 2018 was noticeably slower to respond to touch and longer to download. I also found the text to be somewhat fuzzy. Not only is the 2021 faster to respond, the text seems clearer. Another thing I didn't like about the 2018 was the brightness seemed too bright with too much blue light compared to the original Kindle. I think it was maybe the placement of the screen lighting which is so much better in the newer version even without having to turn on dark mode or warm light. For these reasons I recommend the upgrade for people on the fence about switching from the 2018. For people who are new to the Kindle line-up, here are my complaints about the Paperwhite: Still no physical page-turn buttons and could be more ergonomic for one-hand use. Although the Oasis includes these features, the reported short battery life is a deal-breaker for me for the price-point. Hopefully in the next iteration of the paperwhite Amazon will add these features.

",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I made a pact with myself that I would never buy another Kindle until they came out with USB-C charging as the micro ports are so easy to damage and my last Paperwhite was rendered almost useless because of said port.  So I had to wait two years but it was well worth the wait as the new Paperwhite is everything I‚Äôd hoped for.Dark Mode, yes, finally!Sharp, easy on the eyes text at night, yes!Upgraded lighting and a ‚Äòwarmth‚Äô setting, yes!Expanded sorting - keeping series together, yes!Even though it is still 300ppi it seems higher because of the much improved lighting. I‚Äôm in Kindle heaven right now.*Update:  Okay, my initial excitement has diminished a bit. After using this new Paperwhite for four months I am so disappointed with a BIG FLAW in the design of this which is the power button. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in a slightly different place or if it‚Äôs just too sensitive, but I inadvertently turn it off way too frequently while reading and it‚Äôs become so annoying! This is my fourth Paperwhite and I have never had this problem with the previous models so they definitely changed something, and the question is WHY?  Another smaller problem that is not a big deal really but is also different than previous models is the delay in waking. My other Paperwhites upon awakening immediately show the swipe message, but half the time this new one first says it‚Äôs waking up, then shows the swipe message. It‚Äôs only a couple extra seconds but I just wonder why it‚Äôs doing that.

    I bought this kindle a few weeks ago after my 7th generation stopped working. I had it almost 6 years and I read daily so I was not upset to buy a new one except that I hate having to redownload everything to its memory. I wish it did that automatically. The new one is a little bigger. I thought I would like it but it actually just makes it a little hard to hold and change pages with one hand. I have also struggled  to find a self standing case that works well with this size. It annoys me that almost every time I open the cover of the case I get a ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù msg before I can slide the touch screen to activate it, but otherwise it works much like my prior paperweight. It‚Äôs lightweight, easy to read, and I love the adjustable light functioning. It‚Äôs a good ereader for a person who reads hundreds of books a year.

    I am not as impressed as I was prepared to be.  The touch screen is mediocre at best.  Scrolling down, while reading the tutorial, it jumped over some areas and you have to tediously ease the screen to the proper position.  Page turning is another subject.  You can touch the screen heavily or lightly, and sometimes it will turn 1 page and sometimes 2-4 pages. It‚Äôs annoying trying to find your place again.  I do not use the paper white to search for books on Amazon, it‚Äôs too frustrating.  I search for books, read reviews, and back covers  using the kindle app on my cell phone.  It says it has a 10 week battery life but perhaps that is if you don‚Äôt use it to read.  I have had it for maybe two weeks and I‚Äôve charged it no less than 3 times but I think I have read 4-5 books during that time on it.  So maybe I have above average usage.  I have not tested the waterproof property yet.

I was able to send in my old kindle for 20% off a new kindle, which I completely recommend doing if you have no use for it. I‚Äôve had Nook Glowlights In the past but hated that there would always be bright specks on the screen. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with that. The screen does not have areas hat are brighter than others. The touchscreen works great and the battery life is amazing and my favorite is the warmth feature to change the warmth of the light. I usually purchase the audible narration as an add on to my kindle books, love the whisper sync option so I can pick up where I left off when alternating from audible to the kindle. Kindle Unlimited has also been great. I didn‚Äôt think there would be such good books available, but I was pleasantly mistaken. I do recommend getting a case that has a strap for your hand. Since the bezel is thin it‚Äôs a little awkward to hold. Nothing a case can‚Äôt fix. Happy reading!

    This kindle is perfect! I took it with me on a trip to Hawaii. The battery lasted the whole time, and I was reading a LOT. I was really impressed I didn't have to charge it, and it still lasted me like another couple of days. Very impressed with the battery life! The light & blue light filter are awesome bc you can customize how much you want of each.

    I had a Kindle Keyboard for forever that still worked great, but I was forced to purchase a new kindle because my old one will no longer be supported (won‚Äôt be able to download new books), This new kindle is fine, but the page turning function on my old kindle was so.much.better. It had buttons on both sides of the screen so you could flip pages forward or backward with either hand without moving your fingers, just a little squeeze. Now I can only flip forward on the right, back on the left, giving less options for how I hold the kindle. And it sometimes flips two pages, so you have to keep an eye out for skipping pages. Also, I don‚Äôt like that I have to touch the screen, because now I have to clean my greasy little fingerprints off of it all the time (from lotion, snacks, and just being a human). From a usability standpoint, I‚Äôm really disappointed. And it‚Äôs even worse that I was forced in to buying this when my old kindle worked great.

    I don‚Äôt know why I waited so long to buy a Kindle. I love reading but I slog through books at a slow pace. I have to use a book maker to direct my eyes & rein my mind to focus. I started using OpenDyslexic on my computer a few years ago but did not know that I could change the text on a Kindle to OpenDyslexic! I got my Kindle Paperwhite last night & now I‚Äôm halfway though The Sirens of Titan no more slogging through! This little change to the font, the e-ink screen & dark mode made so much of a difference for me. I‚Äôm not saying to will cure the sick but it made such a difference for me. I have a back log from years that I‚Äôm going to get on my kindle now.

    Bigger and mostly better than the old Paperwhite I had
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Only one dislike, the old one could fit in some of my overshirt pockets and most of my pants pockets.  This is bigger and so I must carry it separately.  I love the extra screen area, it makes reading easier and page turning a little less frequent.  I really like the waterproof feature (although I haven't tested it yet).  My last version drowned when it got put in a bag with some spilled soda.  Oh well.This is a delight to read, especially on the beach when you can't begin to read your phone even at 100% brightness.  The battery life does suffer some from the lighting, but it is well worth it for the ease of reading in dim surroundings.  This is our family's 7th kindle (I still have the one with a keyboard and it still works).  The resolution is great, I put a technical journal PDF on it and tried to read it.  The print was WAY too small to read, but I looked with a powerful magnifying glass and the tiny tiny print was beautifully formed.  I suspect that's part of what makes it easy to read normal print.

    I have used a Kindle for years and bought this new one about 6 months ago.  I like reading on it very much and appreciate the longer battery life.

    UPDATED - ‚ÄúOld Software‚Äù
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My new Kindle arrived on release day, and in all aspects except one, I love it. It is zippy, the text is crisp and clear, and the backlighting is wonderful. I‚Äôm coming from a 7th Gen Kindle (which has now become my husband‚Äôs) so the speed, extra LEDs, and the warm lighting are big improvements for me. I actually love the bigger size, I‚Äôve read 4 books in as many days on it, and I just adore it. That being said, this next part of the review is based purely on the fact that it came with the old software, well the old interface anyway, and the option to update it manually is greyed out. When I contacted customer service (who were RUDE!) they said it is running the current software 5.14 and there are no updates available at this time for the BRAND NEW device. So, is 5.14 supposed to have the old interface? My husband‚Äôs 7th Gen Kindle updated to 5.13.7 and has the new interface. So, it would appear that my Kindle is running ‚Äúnewer‚Äù software, but it sure does look like the old interface to me (see photo). I‚Äôm keeping it because I love it, and with the hopes that there will be an update to fix this obvious software error soon. It really is a GREAT new Kindle otherwise, I just hope they push out an update ASAP, as it appears I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing software issues. I will update my review accordingly. The new fabric cover is excellent! It has a great feel to it, and is lightweight. It is more pink than lavender, which is fine by me. I love the fabric texture a lot.*UPDATE: Customer service reached out to me to let me know that they froze the current software from updating once they discovered that it was causing issues. They are working to resolve the bug, and the software will be updated once it is. I knew it was something along these lines, and it would‚Äôve been helpful to have customer service say that in the first place. Bugs happen, just tell us!

    Horrible UI, great reading experience
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    It's just wonderful to read on an e-ink kindle. They did a great job on the backlight, too.But wow, navigating and using it is just horrible. It took me DAYS to figure out how to go back to the main menu from a book. They added a swipe from the top function that pretty much any phone user knows well. This lets you change settings on the fly, which is great, but the problem is, it establishes that swiping is how you get around. However, there's actually a small tap section at the top of the screen that you need to tap, not swipe, in order to bring up the UI to actually go home. So, way to screw that one up, Amazon. Taping anywhere else just turns the page.Navigating the library and store is also horribly slow and unwieldly. But that matters very little, because you can just use the website or your phone to manage your books, and all you really need from the Kindle is the ability to display and turn pages, and it does that VERY well.

    Warm light less than expected
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this device and thought I would particulary like the warm light.  I have a Samsung tablet  that I read books on with a nice parchment background and thought the warm light would be something similar, it is not.  I find the warm light makes it harder to read in normal circumstances.  It can be beneficial if trying to reduce light in a dark room where you would be keeping your partner awake, but night mode is better for that.  So I NEVER use Warm mode.I have the previous Paprewhite in addition to the 2021 version.  The main thing I like is the bigger screen and better resolution, so much so I would never think of picking up the older one, ever!So there is alot to love with the 2021 Paperwhite, just forget about the warm light.Battery life is fantastic, be sure to turn on Airplane mode for max life. Also finally a type C connector, thank goodness. I bought the Cobak case and that is a terrific buy.The only problem is the Paperwhite is so compelling I have been reading so much I cannot get anything else done around the house!

    A huge improvement for 2018 Paperwhite Owners
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm glad up I upgraded to the 2021 Paperwhite from my 2018 Paperwhite.  I was on the fence about purchasing this Kindle Paperwhite since 2018 version was perfectly fine and the upgrades seemed so incremental (slightly larger screen; faster processor; warm lighting & better lighting array).  All these little changes make for a big difference in reading experience. I'll address all the new features in comparison to the 2018 Paperwhite.Processor Speed.  The processor is fast.  There's no delay in turning pages anymore.  On the 2018 Paperwhite, there was a millisecond delay in touching the screen and turning the page.  There's barely any detectable delay for the 2021 Paperwhite.  White this might not sound like it makes a difference, it changes the reading experience a lot.  The device feels super responsive and makes the reading experience much more encompassing.Screen Size.  The 2021's 6.8"" screen is only .8"" bigger than the 2018, but that makes for a lot of additional text.  When you combine the bigger screen size with the new processor, it makes the reading experience much more immersive.LEDs.  The warm LEDs are a nice touch for nighttime reading.  It's an aesthetic preference but if you like warm colored lights, it's nice.Other miscellaneous things.  - USB C is nice...(microusb's finickiness about being plugged in precisely has always been annoying).  - I don't notice a difference in increased weight because of how it is distributed, but some people might.The 2018 Paperwhite was a great device and I read a lot of very long books on it.  The 2021 Paperwhite iterates and improves on all the annoyances of the 2018 Paperwhite.  Once you experience this version, it would be difficult to go back to reading on an older model.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought a refurbished 2019 kindle last year and I wanted to upgrade because of the battery. I bought the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite a few weeks after it was released and it took some time to get used to (going from a 6 inch display to a 6.8 inch display). I'm not sure if it was just my unit but it's been pretty buggy up to date. I always get this error message out of nowhere and for some reason it's slower than my 2019 Kindle. My unit specifically seemed kind of loose as well but it didn't interfere with anything so I've just learned to ignore it. In terms of battery life, this thing is great! I keep my brightness around 6-9 at night with the warmth midrange and I read for hours on end but it's lasted me forever and a half each time. Being able to control the warmth is something that also made me switch models because the white light was getting to be a bit much before bed on my 2019 model. As for the screen size, I assumed I'd like it because I'd have more content on the screen at once which works well on top of reading with a smaller font (which I always prefer). However, having gone around with it in my bag or even just trying to walk around my home with the Paperwhite in hand is kind of a hassle. I have smaller hands to begin with and even with a pop socket I'm constantly having to reach. It's all together just an uncomfortable reading experience for me compared to the 6 inch display. On another note, the USB-C is a life saver being that I only have to carry one cable for a number of devices. All that being said though, I actually made the switch back to my 2019 Kindle. While the battery, warm light, and USB-C are great, I can't get over the glitching. Also, the 6.8 inch display is too unconventional for my smaller bags and just holding the device in general. I think the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite is a monumental upgrade from previous years, it just wasn't for me.

    I like the new Kindle. But have some things I would like to change.1. There is no wifi on or off. Just airplane mode in and off which works opposite to the idea of wifi on( airplane off) and wifi off (airplane on) and this drives me nuts!!!Amazon, Just just ""wifi on or off""! Im just amazed you wound even make this crazy change!üò§2. Can you change the highlights function?I highlights stuff for notes to be saved later and often this includes a bit of a long paragraph. But the problem is just a slight touch of the highlighted part and the whole thing is immediately changed to edit mode. Can't you guys make it so that a long press is needed instead? I keep bumping my fingers on a highlight and the edit function that pops up bothers me a lot.3. I'm not a fan of the bottom switch. That's the last place I would want to hold when picking up a Kindle or turning it on.

    Buyer beware...three paperwhites in six months that go to frozen white screen
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update June 13, 2022  Amazon has agreed to issue a refund for this Paper White.  I return the product to Amazon tomorrow.  Customer Service, for this organization, continues to consider the customer when it comes to issues such as this; which is very encouraging when doing business with such a big retailer. Update: June 12, 2022  Note:  I seldom write such a negative review but feel other people purchasing this paperwhite should know what they are buying.  3rd replacement 8G paperwhite/box says refurbished even though I originally purchased a new one.I received a third replacement 8G paperwhite (apparently refurbished) from Amazon because the other two units went to a frozen white screen after having it for a short period of time.  I've have had this unit for approximately three/four weeks and was working fine until last night when it started to reboot it's self for no reason and failed to bring up a book or wouldn't go from page to page....once again reverting to the 3rd unit's slow down. The entire device was in slow motion. These are the same things that have happened with the previous two devices eventually leading to nothing but a frozen white screen.Today this unit has been a frozen white screen all day.  I am not able to try and reboot it due to the white screen and turning it off and on does nothing to fix this unit.  I will be calling Amazon and asking for a full refund.  Amazon has been good in replacing this paperwhite (3) times but I am done getting  replacements that keep doing the same thing the previous ones did. There must be something internally wrong in this paperwhite's structure and will research that further on some other web sites since Amazon would not allow me to turn this model in for a different model type the last go around.  I don't want a replacement of the same product at this time.  I am done with this paper white and greatly disappointed that this unit is such a ""lemon"".My other devices which include a five year old Kindle and a newer I Phone are not experiencing any of these issues with either the kindle app or kindle unlimited.  I even changed the charging plug to the new unit with no change to the frozen white screen.  How does a five year old refurbished Kindle still work while this one doesn't?.  Checked my WiFi strength and all is well...no other issues with all the other devices using a WiFi connection.  My I phone and my older kindle are not experiencing the frozen screen or connectivity issues that this Kindle is experiencing.  They both come up without any issues with my Kindle library and Kindle unlimited.I'm not sure how Amazon is going to react with my request, but will update this review once I speak with someone from their helpdesk. They have been very helpful in the past but I wasn't asking for a refund...I accepted a replacement.  I had hoped that the third paperwhite would work as expected and am greatly  disappointed that it did not.  Be thorough in your research before purchasing this paperwhite, or better yet....get a different model.I use Amazon quite a bit and have never had issues with a product such as this reader.  Returns have always been seamless and customer service has always been helpful.  It's very disappointing to be having these issues with a company that I have grown to respect over the years for their efficiency in dealing with  these kinds of issues. I take care of all my electronics and purchased a leather/type protective book cover  for the very first unit. I've used that cover with each of these readers.  The unit itself looks as new as it did the day I received it, but doesn't work anymore.Good luck...I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.

Help files on the device only help after you install the device!No screen freezes so far, everything works fine.The interface is ok, no complaints though it isn't a big improvement from the old one.

    Like Kindle Fire Better
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This my first Kindle reader and probably my last.  I have an older model Kindle Fire that I prefer reading.  The reader's battery lasts much longer, and it is lighter and fits easier into a purse.  However, the reader is more complicated when it comes to marking a page, returning to the book if you look at something else, turning pages.  I like the Fire's ability to show book covers in color.  The Fire will be my next purchase when I tire of this one.

    I have used amazon many times each month and this is the first time the explanation of the item is not well explained  Actually it is very misleading.  I am disappointed in the way it was portrayed and there is no way to tell me that a downloaded book cost as much as a printed one.  What happened to Save the planet!!!

    It's slower than my old kindle keyboard...
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Got a new Kindle because my wife had slowly taken over my old keyboard version. I wasn't worried because I thought newer would be better, but it's anything but. The lack of buttons was a terrible idea as was the flush screen that covers the bezels. The fingerprints that this thing accumulates are horrendous. You can't really hold it without leaving fingerprints around the part of the screen that covers the bezels and the touch controls are finicky. I'll touch the right side of the screen which should trigger a page advance but it often goes in reverse instead. This often causes multiple taps to get what you want, leaving more finger prints. You basically have to bring a cloth with you everywhere you go to wipe them off.The lack of buttons for page turns is a much bigger deal than I anticipated. I really miss the precision of the buttons and the ease of being able to hold the Kindle with one hand, thumb over the advance button. All it took was a bit of pressure to turn the page. I initially looked for a Kindle Keyboard when considering a new purchase, but discovered they had stopped making them. I really wish I had purchased a used one or had seen the Kobo Libra 2, as it also has physical buttons and bezels you can actually touch without leaving fingerprints.My old Kindle is also faster. It starts up and navigates the menus faster than the new one. The new device also occasionally lags. You'll go to turn the page and nothing will happen. You'll two it again thinking the first two just didn't register. Maybe you two it a third or fourth time. Then all of a sudden, it lurches back into action and registers all of the taps launching you forward several more pages than you intended. That may make sense in an app liker Lightroom where you may be trying to adjust multiple files at once and have to wait for the device to catch up, but this is a book. You read a page, turn the page, and then take time to read the next page. You never get going fast enough to explain why the device lags so bad. I really feel like the new ones are a big step back in design.

    This is my first E-reader . These things take some getting used to. I‚Äôm still learning my way around it. I miss being able to go right to a part of a book by flipping through pages based on my mental image of where the words were on the page. However, it‚Äôs awesome that I can make the print larger and adjust the brightness so I can read pretty much anywhere regardless of the surrounding light. And I can carry multiple books around with me in a very small space. I had a technical problem, but I actually got good technical assistance by phone. The tech person had great communication.

    Missing Immersion Reading
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the previous generation Paperwhite and loved the immersion reading feature (the audiobook plays through headphones while the text being said is highlighted.) After it was stolen I bought the newest generation and was disappointed to find that the immersion reading feature doesn't exist on it! It's very strange that this device has now been released for a while and still doesn't have this feature.Another pretty minor negative is that the device is a bit heavier than the last generation, so more uncomfortable for holding for long periods of time.The screen warmth feature is nice for winding down at night. I guess I will have to live with listening to the audiobook on my phone and manually turning through the book. Hopefully they bring this feature back soon.

    In 2019 I traded in my kindle for an Oasis. Unfortunately, I forgot to check the seat pocket on a flight and left it behind. And yes, you can call Amazon to have it reported lost and they shut it down. I was wondering if I could spend less to replace it and be satisfied? I like the paperwhite better. I have small hands and arthritis in my thumbs. This is actually easier for me to handle and has the wonderful lighting of the Oasis that doesn‚Äôt contribute to my insomnia.

    The Kindle I've been waiting for!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    For years now, I've had all USB-C devices - except for my Kindle. Luckily, the Kindle battery lasts a long time. Unluckily, this means I usually can't remember where I put my micro-USB charger when I need to charge it again. When I saw that a new Kindle was available that used USB-C chargers instead of the old micro-USB, I immediately bought it. Now I can use one charger for all my devices and that right there would have made me happy. But this device gets five stars because it's made me love Kindle all over again.I prefer dark mode on my computer and phone. I now have one on my Kindle!The bezels on this thing aren't quite razor thin yet - but it's about the size of my old Kindle with much more screen real estate.The battery lasts longer.For the first time ever, I paid to have the ads turned off. Even without doing that, I can tell you the page turns are faster than before too.Using this Kindle vs my last one is night and day.

    A Good Solid Kindle Device.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I bought it to replace my 6-inch Voyage and because I was interested in a bigger screen.  I love the screen, but I miss the physical buttons on my Voyage.  The screen tap method works OK, but a tap the right side of the screen turns the page forward, and a tap on the left turns the page backward.  I'd prefer to have the top part of the screen turn back pages, and the bottom part turn pages forward.  I have years of muscle memory to overcome, plus, it would make one handed page turns more comfortable.  Maybe this could be fixed in a software update?  It'd be great if that were done.I also like the smooth screen that integrates solidly with the bezel.  No dust to collect in the corners.  The Type ""C"" connector is much appreciated.  The sooner we get to a single 'universal' connection standard, the better, in my mind.I don't really use the other stuff.  Warm screen options, more lights, seem irrelevant to me.  They work, but after checking to see that they do work, I don't really know how well they work on a day-to-day basis.I'm kind of surprised at how limited the 3rd party case options are for this device.  I'd have thought Amazon would have been more aggressive in recruiting 3rd party developers.I don't regret buying this device, it's a good solid Kindle device with no glaring negative features.

It isn‚Äôt quite as ergonomic to hold as my previous one and I find myself accidentally turning pages often, which is a milder complaint. There is a method to temporarily turn off all touch screen functions except to swipe pages, however I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me, but it takes several swipe just to turn page.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The battery life is better, the screen a bit bigger, and I like that it is water resisted.

    I am a owner of the kindle keyboard with page turner on each side. I also have a generation 6.  I figured with updated technology the 2021 would be easier to read the hone screen and my library.  I have MS and it gets hard to read the list.That theory and reasoning went out the window.  1st - the fo nt is smaller and lighter 9n the home/library screen. Than either of my e readers.  The book layout is fuzzy and dark no matter how bright.  But fuzzy...blurry..however you want to put it, is usualess so i put it on list.  It's in light printer, the 6th is bold print.I can change my book font fine.  But its usualess if I can't find the title or read to put in Groups.  I have a lot of books so my eye strain would literally be impossible.I was sitting there last night setting it up with a magnifying glass.  My vision changes as my MS does. So at least the 6th print is bold.I called chatted with the help line to see if there was a way to e hence or enlarge the hone screen/library and while I turned it on to follow steps he gave me (before finding out it can't be done) as I turned it on.  I swiped it, then it started a reboot the white out on me.  I turned it off, gave it a few seconds ds,  still nothing but white page.  The svc te h told me to shut it down, wait 10 mi utes and restart the eReader.  I did and it came back up after looking like going through another reboot. As I stated after he had me do things his supervisor said it couldn't be done.I almost bought the 7 inch kindel fire 32 gb for 32.98 . I have a 8 inch so 8i debated to get the 7inch instead of a new eReader.So it's going back due to whiting out and I can't read it.  I wish I had gone with my gut and gotten the 7 inch fire fore 32.98I can't get that deal again,  since prine is over.  but my Gen 6 is working fine so I guess I will wait till Christmas to see if the 7 inch goes on sale.Very disappointed. Even the 1st little keyboard the page turners were on there, for 89.00 full price.  now you have to pay prime $$ to get the function that was a norm.This isn't for me.I

    I've had my ""new"" Kindle for about 2 weeks and I can safely say this is the best I've had.  I love the quick action going into sleep mode; is easy to handle; it charges way faster than my older Kindle; and the charge lasts longer, too.It has a ""WAKE UP"" mode for when it's off for quite a while; click the button and it goes from ""wake up"" to ""swipe to unlock"" and you're all set.  I have noticed a huge increase in how long the power charge lasts which I love.  The brightness is better than the old Kindle, also.The best part is the instructions showed me how to get rid of 22 pages of ""group by author/series"" catalogs that came at the end of my books.  Gosh, I HATED those, especially when the books I haven't read yet got mixed up in the bunch!!Overall, thanks Amazon for the new Kindle and all it good features!

    I very much love this new kindle. They finally got around to a lot of improvements that should've honestly been done a while ago, such as the USB-C port and improved battery life. I also love that it's so light and easy to hold. I may be in the minority, but I appreciate that it's still got a bit of a bezel to hold onto. My only real complaint is with the most recent software update that has restructured the home page. The ability to scroll and that the titles are a little smaller is appreciated. However, I really hate that there's no longer a toggle between downloads/full library. You can still do it via the filters, but it's such an unnecessary extra step when I get a new book I'm trying to download. All of the other improvements are wonderful.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgraded to this device from the 6‚Äù Kindle. Nothing wrong with the old one, I just thought this one offered more bells and whistles than the last iteration. Spoiler Alert - it does not.Recently, I finally bit the bullet and began taking advantage of my Audible membership. I like using my Galaxy Note20 Ultra phone to read on because it‚Äôs easier to manage, size-wise. The Kindle app for Android is fantastic! It loads in seconds, and it‚Äôs very versatile and responsive. And when I use Audible, I can read along with the narrator.When I got my new Paperwhite Kindle, I was excited to do the same thing. However, on the Paperwhite, not only can you NOT read along with the narrator (you‚Äôre given the choice of text with no audio, or audio with no text). I‚Äôm baffled as to why an app performs better, and has better options than the device itself.Also, there is no speaker on the Paperwhite, so, you‚Äôre forced to use a Bluetooth device to enjoy your audiobooks. On my phone, I don‚Äôt need to use.an ancillary listening device. With the Paperwhite, you have to touch the very top of of the screen to access an unimpressive menu; on the app, you can touch anywhere on the page, where you can bring up a menu with several more options. With the app, I can also color-code my highlights. I use one color for words I‚Äôve just learned, and another color for key phrases, another color for foreign words, and, yet another for names I want to look up later. You get none of that on the Kindle device.Honestly, the Kindle app has this thing beat in every category. It makes me wonder why I even bought the thing, when the free app is decidedly better in every way, other than screen size.All in all, I actually like the Paperwhite Kindle. However, after forking over $150 (including tax), I still find myself reading on my phone quite a bit. There are times when I‚Äôm going out, and carrying two devices can be cumbersome, I obviously opt for my phone over the Kindle as the device I‚Äôll take with me.Dear Amazon, on your next Kindle iteration, please:1) add a speaker to your Kindle2) Give users the option to read along with the narration. I‚Äôve found it makes the narrators performance even more impressive.

    Pain With Transfers
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    We bought two newer versions of Kindle Paperwhite for a number of reasons. The devices appear to be solidly built and for newbies, these are great readers. For those of us who have been using an older model and wanted to upgrade, the path is full of rocks. There appears to be no easy way to transfer OLD content, bookmarks, etc to the NEW paperwhite. A simple software solution would be to offer a ""transfer"" function especially for those who do a trade-in. How would it work? Click ""transfer content"" then choose the FROM Kindle paperwhite name and then TO Kindle name. Downloading every book, document et al one by one...or everything and then exclude items one by one is painful. If I find (or am informed) of a simple way to do this, I will update this review but at the moment, I am in the midst of trying to upgrade two Kindles...

    I have so many ebooks but never could finish any of them because I would get distracted with all the apps on my phone. The kindle paper white is the perfect solution. I set mine for dark mode which is really easy on the eyes. It‚Äôs simple enough to use. I thought the ads would be annoying but they aren‚Äôt. The size is nice and the battery last a long while. The only down side is the library view only shows 6 books at a time, this can take forever to scroll through if you have lots of books. Also the browsing function for books is not user friendly. I tried to find some books for my daughter on the kindle paperwhite and I could filter through them adequately. Finding new books is just easier on the app or website. Very happy I have it and would recommend to others.

    This is not a technical review because I don‚Äôt pay attention to or know anything about specifics of brightness or whatnot.

Read with one hand. At time of purchase, mine came with 4 months of free kindle unlimited. Unfortunately, I love it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll continue to pay for it but for the time being, let me tell you, I am taking advantage. Use your library for books too. I love that it is so easy to look up books in the kindle store and I LOVE that I can pair it with my Goodreads account. This helps me track my books efficiently and remember to at least give a star rating for my thoughts when I finish a book.I love reading this in bed at night. I can turn the brightness levels down, there is a dark mode setting, I can make the font bigger when I take off my glasses‚Ä¶Buy this and love your reading life. Highly recommend.

    Confusing Replacement for Original Kindle
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My first discovery with this new Kindle was that it no longer offers direct book ordering from Amazon via my desktop.  You must have Wi-Fi to access your library or order a book.  The new layout is confusing: you no longer have a list of books in your library, but rather pictures of book covers, arranged in no apparent order.  I was able to find the book I had been reading on my old Kindle (it died after five years of heavy use), but the discovery was by chance.The former manual keys for advancing or retreating pages are gone.  There are no keys at all.  Everything is touch screen.  For someone like myself with Carpal-Tunnel Syndrome, this can be difficult.  I'm getting used to it.The visual text quality is superior to the old Kindle, although detailed graphics such as maps or drawings are no better than before.  Overall, I wish I could get my old Kindle back.

    A big welcomed upgrade
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the 2018 paperwhite for over a year and it was a great device but I always wished it had a bigger screen and warm lighting. I always knew warm lighting was better for the eyes but once you actually experience it it becomes essential. My eyes feel so much better reading for long periods. I always keep it on no matter what. I might turn it down when I have my overall brightness higher but it is always on. And the extra screen means less page turns and feels more equal to the size or a paperback book. The page turn animation is a very nice touch and makes the experience better adding some life to reading on a kindle. I'd highly recommend buying a case as the smaller bezels make it look sleek it also makes it harder to hold and the case adds some extra thickness making it easier to hold one handed. The quicker page turns and it feeling faster overall is a huge plus. I don't need lightning speed from a kindle but having the updated internet for it to support higher bandwidth makes it so much faster going through the store. I honestly don't see a huge difference in overall lighting with all the extra LED lights but that was never a selling point for me as I thought the previous ones brightness was fine. Overall I'd highly recommend buying this kindle even if you have the previous paperwhite. I can't imagine not having warmlight and the bigger display now. This will be my kindle for a very long time as I can't imagine needing more features than this for reading text.

    I mostly love everything about the new 11th generation kindle paperwhite!First, really quick, let me say what I don't like: it is heavier than previous generation, and the max brightness level sometimes doesn't seem bright enough in certain bright lighting. But these are minor and I still give 5 stars!I love the larger screen, closer margins, warm light is amazing for night reading, the charging port is updated to the usb-c so I can now use one charger for all my devices, the page looks even more textured for a more book like paper appearance, and battery life still great in my opinion! I usually only have to charge it once a week, but being a mom I don't get to read very heavily (moderatley and mostly at night). The warm light can be put on an automatic schedule or it can be set and adjusted easily from drop down quick menu. It was easy to connect to my Amazon account (it was a gift and not automatically connected). Very happy so far with it! I can never go back to reading on a phone/tablet again, this is much easier on the eyes by far!

    I don't like the lag that appears when I scroll. It just seems for the price tag that would have been something that would have been figured out already. I defnitely enjoy it to read books and someone who use to only read physical books, this is great since I can take it anywhere with me and I no longer have to hide scandalous book covers for some romance novels ;). I would highly recommend this to someone who is thinking of buying but hast commited yet. The battterly lasts weeks to and kindle unlimited has a lot of great options to read from.

    I loved my first Paperwhite purchased in 2013. I even bought them as gifts for several family members. I upgraded to a later model about 3 years ago and the battery life was practically nonexistent. So I tried again a couple of months ago and all was well‚Äîthe battery lasted longer and it worked as usual. Then it became necessary to restart almost every time I downloaded a new book. When I asked support about it their solution was to simply restart every time. Not happy. If I could figure out how to do it I‚Äôd go back to my first one.

I like that I can change the font color and size as well as type of font. I prefer black page and white letters for night because less light to disturb my husband. I am so glad I made the purchase.

    I originally left a 1 star review due to Amazon's poor service in the beginning for not helping me when my Kindle was damaged. I didn't have it for 30 days and the originally man I spoke with pretty much blew me off. Thankfully a day after I posted my review I was contacted by Amazon and the service I received was ten times better. The second man was very kind and was not rude to us. They refunded us for a new Kindle and we will be sending them back the old damaged one (obviously). I am very thankful for the help. The Kindle is an amazing product that I highly recommend. I wish I caught the name of the second man he was very kind (I think it was James??)

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I wasn't sure if I preferred this Kindle over my much older model at first, but I soon grew to love the bigger reading surface size size. I had some issues with the touch screen being a bit buggy, not advancing when I wanted it to, sometimes moving backwards when I wanted it to advance. I figured I just needed to get used to it, and I think I did get better at using it.  After a few months of use I noticed one small scratch on the screen, which I had never had happen to a kindle before. It wasn't super noticeable unless I was reading in sunlight. A few weeks later,  it simply froze up, and would not restart. They sent a replacement in the same model. After a month of use, the replacement has several scratches on the screen, one very noticeable, several somewhat noticeable if I'm reading in the sun. I've had both kindles in Amazon brand cases, I don't place it face down on surfaces, I always close the cover when I put it in a bag, etc. but I do read a lot in a lot of places. I've never had this happen before with any other kindle. Definitely consider a screen protector with this one.

Or at least make it flush with the bottom!!It‚Äôs bigger than the recent versions and I don‚Äôt need the added weight and size.When the kindle wakes, it always defaults to bright blueish light until it realizes it was supposed to be warm light.

    OK - Amazon starts out by asking, What did I use this product for...Guys, it's a reader. I didn't buy it to lay bricks.Not my first Kindle, alas my old one (a Gen 3 Keyboard) finally died an ugly death; had to replace it, and can't even begin to say how much I miss it.  The warm backlighting on this model is nice, I will admit, but that's the only thing I find to like.  The software keeps cutting out at odd moments -- pages don't turn, it is needlessly, obnoxiously difficult to move from chapter to chapter, and the library concept should have died in the womb.  It used to be a list, like for people who can read -- now it's a crappy, cumbersome clot of PICTURES -- I assume to assist the population subset of reader buyers who cannot actually read -- that takes forever (and a lot of excessive moves) to navigate through, and demands a whole lot of other unnecessary complications to do anything with.  Amazon is following the same trajectory as other device producers, given time: degrade the basic product despite a couple nicer features, and ignore what worked for the customer in favor of what Amazon wants.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    With over 6000 reviews i know my 2 cents worth may not mean a lot, but I'm giving a review anyway. The reason I purchased the Paperwhite was my older Fire HD gen 8's battery was starting to discharge fairly fast. I read a lot and figured from the favorable reviews, the Paperwhite with it supposed long battery life sounded good. I thought I didn't need a Fire just to read. Wrong! First impression, the Paperwhite is nice and light, compared to the weight of my Fire.  From there it was down hill. After giving it a week or so I was still unable to get a comfortable reading brightness and print darkness. Can't darken the print, only make the font bigger, which sucks. It's just gray and gives me eyestrain and the yellow warm light is a joke. My Fire has more font, spacing, and margin adjustments. Looking at books in my library is almost useless, the covers are just grey with little detail. Really, really miss that color here. Can't turn off Wi-Fi. You can only turn airplane mode on. That sucks battery down. And yes I turned battery saver on. That just makes you wait a bit for the reader to wake up. Battery life still not what's advertised. And don't get me started on the ""leather"" cover. It's a chunk of plastic with the thinnest, hardest leather known to man. It does protect the reader quite well but sounds like a plastic dinner plate when you set it on a table. All in all the Paperwhite is not worth its price and eye stain, I'm going back to my Fire HD. It is so much easier to read on and I don't have to go to my phone to read emails.  Maybe I'll figure out how to replace its battery. AND, I love having that color.

    My grandson gave me a paper white for Christmas. It was working great and I downloaded about 10 books in my library.  Then it quit working today. When I try to bring up the page to read, it is blank white. No words appear. So, from the end of December until the end of April, that is only 4 months.  What's the deal with this?UPDATE: I was surprised when a representative called me and was willing to walk  me through the restart proceedure. It is working fine right now. I'll wait and see if I have any more problems with it.  I originally gave this a one star review, but changed it to a 3 when I was contacted. I shouldn't have any problems with it at all.  My old Kindle with the key board and buttons still works fine, and I never had any problems with it. But after December I was told I couldn't download new books to it. So, my grandson bought me a Paperwhite Kindle.  After reading some of the bad reviews, you'd think they would fix the glitches with their paperwhite Kindle.  After doing a re-boot, it seems to be working fine now. I'll reserve further comment to see if this happens again. My old one, they just updated every so often and I never had any problems with it. What has happened to the quality?  My old one lasted over 10 years! It isn't broken, they just quit supporting it and would no longer let you download new books to it.  Why are there so many glitches in the Paperwhite version?

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have buying Kindles since the Kindle 2 back in 2009.  I‚Äôve purchased the K2, K3, Voyage (the best offering IMHO), Oasis (worst offering in my POV), the original Paperwhite, and the 2018 Paperwhite.  This Kindle is a modest improvement over the 2018 Paperwhite.  It starts MUCH faster.  The lighting is great.  And, it‚Äôs a little bigger.  The placement of the power button at the bottom has never been an issue for me, so I don‚Äôt mind it.  Hardware is fine.My only complaints are related to the software.  Amazon has gotten MUCH more aggressive in pushing content.  Each software ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù makes it worse.  (Same reason I couldn‚Äôt stand the Fire tablet & recently ditched the 4K Fire Stick.) I have never really minded ads on the Kindle before because they didn‚Äôt interfere with getting to my content and sometimes I found a book I wanted to read.  But recent software updates annoyingly push Amazon content to the forefront, something I resent in a device that I‚Äôve purchased.  I strongly believe the ‚Äúhome‚Äù screen should be configured by the customer, rather than  consisting of advertisements!  I paid to have ads removed, but that only impacts the screensaver, so certainly not worth $20.  Let me get rid of ALL ads, and I‚Äôd pay three times that!Another complaint is that Amazon randomly pushes updates, and it‚Äôs annoying that they can‚Äôt be delayed or scheduled!  One more issue ‚Äî for heaven‚Äôs sake please turn off auto highlights!  They are SO annoying, and the feature is buried, so not intuitive to turn off.  I bet that the percentage of customers who want this feature is tiny, but Amazon continues to default to it.I still love the Kindle and think it‚Äôs the best device for reading.  But, I my reservations grow, and I fear that aggressiveness in pushing content will soon ruin it.  If this continues, I will be looking at other options and don‚Äôt mind paying more if I can be rid of ads and simply enjoy reading.  If you‚Äôre going to charge for a device, then let customers have control of it.  If the device is merely a way to push content (as the Kindle is fast becoming), then give it away to prolific readers.

    I have an old Paperwhite that I got used in 2017. It finally got a crack in the screen, so I had to replace it. My old one used the same charger as my phone, which was very convenient. This new one needs a specific charger which is a pain to remember to pack if traveling. The screen is larger, which is nice. But the smaller margins make it difficult to hold without constantly accidentally changing pages. I read curled up on my side 99% of the time, and I always lose my page (sometimes it skips several pages, and it's difficult to find where you left off), or drop the Kindle trying not to touch the screen. It also frequently locks up and won't respond. The worst part is that your books aren't actually there. We recently had a power outage for several days. I finished the book I was reading and went to my library to start a new one.  It couldn't open any of my books because it had no internet connection. Rendered it completely useless. I camp frequently (no internet in the woods) so I'm extremely disappointed. I went back to my cracked screen Kindle during the outage, but the battery was almost dead and didn't last long. The battery life on this one is ok, and the light filter is a nice touch. But between being difficult to hold if you're a side reader and not functioning without internet connection renders it nearly useless for me. I much prefer my older Paperwhite.

    I upgrade from a kindle that was 10 years old. The main reason for why I got a new one is that I wanted one that was water resistant and didn't want to worry about damaging it while sailing. I am really enjoying this new kindle. I like the touch screen (major upgrade from my old one), the screen is a good size. It's not too big and fits enough words on it that I am not constantly flipping to the next page. I like how you can turn up the brightness if you want to. I have been mostly keeping the brightness all the way down because you don't need it if you're in good light. When you do turn the brightness up all the way it's too bright. The battery life seems to be good too. I have used it every day for 1-3 hours since I got it (6 days now) and the battery is at 77%. I did get worried the first day that I got it because I thought that the battery had already fallen to 85%, but then I realized that I was looking at the percentage of the the book that I already read. The layout of the Kindle is very different than my old one (not too surprising since my old one is 10 years old) and it did take me a few minutes to learn the new layout. Overall I am very happy.

    After eight years my iPad had seen better days. For the past few years, I had only been using it to read e-books, and spending the money for a new one didn't make sense. I decided to try out a Kindle because I had been using the app on my iPhone and iPad and didn't have any problems. I was concerned after reading a few reviews that I wouldn't be able to borrow books through Libby on this device. Don't let the negative reviews scare you away-it's very easy to get books from Libby onto this device!It does come with the charging cable, but not the adapter to plug it into the wall. However, chances are you already have a USB wall adapter. You can also charge it via your laptop or desktop if for some reason you don't have a USB adapter.I did find that was a little awkward to hold, but a Popscocket fixed that problem!

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    When I closed the cover on my previous paperwhite, it turned off the light but did not lock the screen.  When I opened it, I could go right back to reading where I left off.  With the new one, you have to swipe away the lockscreen before you can get back to reading.  It does not matter whether or not you have the ad-support feature.  I understand that there are times when you want your kindle to lock when you close it, but it is very annoying to have it always lock.  Disabling ""power saver"" mode has no impact.  Customer support verified that disabling the lock screen was possible on previous paperwhites but not on this version.So annoying!

    Unimpressed - and Amazon is not honoring their 3-mo free Unlimited deal!
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    First off: I got an email saying my purchase qualified for 3 months free Unlimited. When I clicked on the link to add it to my Kindle, it said the purchase was NOT qualified. Customer Support said I could sign up for one month free, then pay for two additional months, then contact them at the end of that three month period for a refund. Uh... no.Secondly: the software is so slow... I used a friend's 2008 Kindle and it was faster to scroll, turn the page, and respond to the touch screen. I have to tap several times to get this to do anything. If it doesn't improve in a week, I'm returning it!

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I used to be able to sort into collections and view my books within the collection in a concise list view. I have no need to see the book jacket (which is actually missing in some of the books anyway) The only way to see my books in a list view is to have my library filled with all my books and collections in a mixed up manner.  What is the point of a collection if I cannot find it among my books (I keep hundreds of books on my kindle.)  I used to enjoy my kindle, recommend to everyone, but now I find it very frustrating.  Amazon, please fix this latest update to correct this issue. This is what it used to be: library should have only collections in a list, collections should show a list of books.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Design:- Very thin and lightweight- Plastic is soft and doesn't feel cheap to hold.- Water resistant- Display is good quality, good resistance to fingerprints and glare, and can get very bright or low during reading.Features:- The battery life will last your whole life it seems- USB-C is a nice touch- software is pretty good for a e reader- tons of storage for books- Kindle Unlimited is a must have- The ads on the homescreen are not that badI currently own a Iphone 12 pro max. On paper the screen size doesn't look like a big upgrade, put in person the screen on the kindle is much more wider and the bezels make it easier to hold; not to mention that a E-ink display is a lot better for your eyes and puts less strain. Also less distraction than a phone or tablet.

    It is more than disappointing that no written instruction manual accompanies this product. I purchased my first Kindle at least 11 years ago and have used the tiny pamphlet of instructions since. Even the manuals advertised have terrible reviews. It is ridiculous to have access only to online instructions or those within the Kindle itself. Some people can still read a written page, Maybe this issue should be remedied.

    I never thought I‚Äôd love this product as much as I do! The battery lasts a long time (2+ weeks easily with me reading for hours every day) and the device is super comfortable to hold. You can adjust the screen to dark mode and turn the brightness down really far. I love having the Kindle Unlimited subscription too. Definitely saving lots of money and space with this product.

    + bigger screen+ warm light (night mode)+ more responsive/faster (compared to Paperwhite 3)+ battery life+ USB-C+ faster charging (compared to Paperwhite 3)- increased dimensions (compared to previous Paperwhite) - I think that keeping the same dimensions should be a higher priority, than having much bigger screen- slightly more glossy screen (compared to Paperwhite 3)In general - it's a worth upgrade from Paperwhite 3 (I'm glad I've skipped Paperwhite 4).

    Old software on new device UPDATE.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My new paperwhite came with old software and, like another reviewer pointed out, the option to update to the new software was greyed out. I used the chat option to talk to customer service, and they are sending me a new one because they apparently did not have a way to update the device. Overall I like the new paperwhite, and my experience with customer service was positive. I‚Äôm disappointed that I have to wait a week for a replacement, but sometimes these things happen and it‚Äôs not the end of the world.Update: I received the replacement and had the same issue. After 1.5 hours chatting with five customer service representatives, the fifth representative was finally able to figure out that there was a problem with the updates and the technical team is working on it. So I‚Äôm happy to know this is just a bug, and that they are working on resolving the issues. For those of you who are experiencing the same thing, I wanted you to know Amazon is aware and working on the issue. I really like the new device and the amber lighting option is a game changer for those of us who read in bed in the dark.Update 2: The software updated on my new device on November 10th, so now I can give this five stars. I like the larger screen and the amber lighting for nighttime reading.

    I'll be frank.....I didn't want a Kindle. I felt that they were obsolete. Then, one day my eyes hurts from staring at my phone's screen and I remarked to myself, ""I wish there was a way to read books without hurting my eyes or draining the battery on my phone. Not to mention, freeing up much needed memory........Wait......"" Enter the Kindle. Overall, I'm satisfied with my device. I find it a better buy than a tablet. It focuses on reading - books, manga, and graphic novels in my case - and it has none of the distractions. I feel it will help me better myself and fulfill at least one of my New Year Resolutions. My only complaint is that the battery life. Yes, it lasts but I don't think I'll get anywhere near what Amazon says.

    Excellent upgrade over my 2012 Kindle 5th generation edition. Glad I upgraded.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My 5th generation Kindle worked just fine and sometimes I would get an application error but I just restarted the device and it went away. The 11th generation has a larger 6.8"" display and looks a lot better than the older Kindle. I put both side by side and I really didn't notice a difference with the page turning speed but the main difference for the upgrade was the extra display size. I had a great soft leather case for the older Kindle and couldn't find one for the newer one so I finally went with the CoBak black smart cover case. I purchased it on a deal so I feel its worth the upgrade because I like to read primarily before retiring for the evening.

    Subtle but nice improvements in this model
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the last version and this is a nice upgrade.  Like the slightly larger size, very easy to read and like the new lighting options as well as the longer battery life.  But there are a couple default settings I think should be changed.  One is you see the popular highlights shown in a book, and in my opinion that should be off by default.  I would think most people would want that off.  The other option I liked was the new page turn animation.  I stumbled across it by accident and it is off by default, I really think that should be on.  It is found by, when reading a book, tap the top edge of the screen and then tap the font symbol ""Aa"" and then tap ""More"" and then scroll down and you'll see it.  I liked it more than I expected and I really believe that should be on by default, as I believe most people would like that on as well.

    So much better than 2018
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this kindle so much. The screen is huge but it is still small and compact enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm carrying around a tablet- it still keeps the lightness and portability of a kindle. The response time on the screen is so much faster than the 2018. I would get frustrated with my old one at how slow it loaded and how many times I had to tap on something before it registered that I was touching the screen. The color is easier on your eyes while reading too. It is a little pricey, but overall all definitely worth the upgrade. Also a tip for people who experience technical difficulties, just send the Amazon customer service chat a message explaining it and they will send a new one. Don‚Äôt give something a bad review because of a defective product.

    No Longer an Easier on the Eyes Than a Computer or Tablet
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Pluses: The new Kindle has a very sharp screen, is light and comfortable to hold, ""wakes up"" easily when I open my case and preserves a charge nicely when I close it.Neutrals: pictures in grayscale are definitely sharper, but do we really need 300 dpi type for reading? Also, I prefer using a narrow column, so the additional width is wasted on me.Negatives: Alas, the modern Kindle fails in its basic task, which is to be easier on the eyes than a modern tablet or computer, no matter how many shades of 17 diode light or mango I apply. I can download a Kindle Reader app on any of them plus my phone and read at least as easily. My very old Keyboard Kindle actually had a much softer presentation, back when computers really hurt to read on.Second problem (software) is that highlighting text tends to take long to ""grab"" and sometimes brings down the preference screen instead.Third: I purchased the bundle, and I am not aware that the nine volt charger really charges much faster than the five.I will say that the Kindle keeps me from playing solitaire when I read a tough passage; I just stop and do something else productive.

    I just upgraded from a 2nd Generation Kindle, so this is a huge upgrade for me. The backlit screen is fabulous for when I'm reading in bed and don't want to have to use a reading lamp, and the paperwhite screen is perfect for when I'm reading outdoors or in a bright room. Very easy on the eyes.  The touch screen is a little slower than what I'm used to, but I like the smaller size (compared to my old kindle) and I'm thrilled that I can listen to my audiobooks with Bluetooth. Perfect. Love my new Paperwhite.

    This is my wife's second Kindle.  The first one which is about 5 or 6 years old quit charging because the bottom connector went bad. When I saw they upgraded to a USB C connector I knew it was time.  I think the old USB Micro connectors are a PIA.  Her new one is great. It synced right out of the box and connected to WiFi immediately.  The thing is perfect!  Sooo mine will arrive tomorrow.  (Been reading off an old Fire)  What bugs me are the reviewers that give this product one star because it didn't work out of the box or they were too dumb to figure it out.  If it doesn't work send it back and get another one.  It couldn't be easier with Amazon.  Giving it one star because it didn't work says nothing about a good one that does work.  I bet a bad one is one in a thousand or more.  Give it a break...just get another one.

    It's faster than my old paperwhite which I love.  But I HATE the popular highlights.  It's like buying a used textbook and seeing someone else's notes.  Amazon has made it a default feature and the only way to turn it off is in each individual book.  This sucks and it's unnecessary for me to have to turn it off every time I read a book.  Amazon can and should do better.

    The photo shows 5th gen (same size as 10) vs 11th gen.The kindle has long been my favorite device. You can take my phone away, but not my kindle. I would not usually be an early adopter of the new version, but after 8 years, my old kindle finally started acting up. Overall, the gen 11 is great.Pros- Bigger is better. I can now increase the font size without reducing the words per page, which is great for older eyes.- USB-C fits either way- Adjustable background (white to amber)- Sync‚Äôing cloud content is easy- Typing and paging are slightly fasterCons (minor, but there are a few)- The power button protrudes slightly, so when I prop the kindle upright, it sometimes turns off.- Sync‚Äôing local content, if you have any, from your old Kindle is a bit time consuming.- Even with the brighter screen and adjustable warmth, the gen 11 is still not as white as my old kindle. I have brightness on max and warmth on low. Its still a very clear screen, but I would prefer a pure white background.- I would like more font choices, like Calibri.  I use Caecilia, which is fine, but not my favorite.

    Beside general reading, I use my kindle every night, to help me fall asleep when I wake up at night.  I normally need to wear reading glasses, but with the old kindle, could switch to large print and low light very simply, using two icons at the top of page.  Now I actually have to get my glasses on just to make those simple adjustments.  They have over-thought  the improvements on these things!  Should have stayed simple.And with all this, they still haven‚Äôt come up with a remote for the darn thing.  They need to make a little device you can put on your thumb, or hand, which you can press to advance pages.  Then a person can prop up the kindle and relax, let go of it, and still use it easily.

    I had the previous generation of Kindle paperwhite (2018 version) and decided to trade-in for the new version around black Friday 2021. However the trade-in process took longer than expected and I could not get the deal on the new version for $105.Anyways, ended up buying the new version for full price ($130) and after few weeks of usage, don't see any material upgrade from 2018 version, and therefore don't see it worth the high price.At night, I prefer using the dark mode versus warm light. So that feature is useless as well.

    I had an older model (keyboard at the bottom) that worked well was easy to use.  Amazon said something about no more support.  Got the Paperwhite.  The touch screen is so touchy that sometimes when my hand passes over the screen it jumps 3 or 4 pages, the library is very difficult to use, i have downloaded books from my library on my amazon account 2 or 3 time and only 2 or 3 will make it.  I have had a great deal of difficulty removing downloads from my kindle and returning them to my amazon storage.  This has a lot of useless features, if I wanted all of that crap, I would have ordered a fire tablet or downloaded the kindle app on my tablet.  The beauty of the old unit was simplicity itself.  It was a hundred books in a light carry package, easy to use.  Every time i finish a book now it takes an hour to get rid of the old and try to find a new.  But there are lots of ads (I paid extra for no ads) for other books.  If i hadn't traded the old one I would already have it back out and using it.

    I love this Kindle - super light weight, adjustable back light, nice size... it's everything I hoped it would be.  This is a bit nitpicky but you can see in the picture how I found that I naturally want to hold the Kindle with my right hand - basically resting on my right ring finger.  Well, it didn't take very long to figure out that the power button is exactly in that spot (noted with red arrow in pic) so if I hold it like that, I am toggling the power button all the time.  It's annoying (obviously) so I've adjusted to other ways to hold the Kindle and all is wonderful.  But my instinctual way of holding it causes the power button problem.  No big deal.  Still totally worth it for me.  That small issue is what prevented a perfect 5-star rating!

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôm absolutely disappointed. I‚Äôve been using a prior version of paperwhite for seven years and absolutely love it. It‚Äôs just the perfect size and weight for me to hold on one hand to read at bed before sleeping. My old kindle unfortunately broke down and I didn‚Äôt think twice before buying a new paperwhite. However I was sad to find that paperwhite is not the same anymore. Its bezel gets so thin and with the flush screen it‚Äôs just very hard to hold it tightly on one hand without accidentally touching the screen. I know we can lock the touch screen but that doesn‚Äôt solve the issue for me as when I‚Äôm holding it on one hand I can‚Äôt make a long enough swipe to turn page - I don‚Äôt have large enough hands! Then I try to use landscape mode to hold the thickest bezel while reading but that can‚Äôt be done either - the landscape mode only allows one direction, and it‚Äôs the wrong direction - meaning, if I want to hold the side of the thicker bezel with my right hand, the words would be upside down. After so many attempts I just got so angry with Amazon. Why do they have to do this to my fav paperwhite. Why I does every digital divice HAVE TO have larger screen? I just don‚Äôt see the point. Now I have to return this uncomfortable to hold kindle and buy a new one and just lose all the prime day discount  (I made my original purchase on prime day, I should‚Äôve purchased a smaller kindle that day ugh). I‚Äôm very dissatisfied with the stupid upgrade of 2021 paperwhite. I hate the thin bezel and slippery back and the larger size and heavier weight and the flush screen. I hate basically every upgrade Amazon made to the outlook of paperwhite. I really just hope I can get the old paperwhite back.

    I love the 6.8‚Äù screen for one. It is the perfect size for me and not as awkwardly shaped as Oasis (though I do miss the page turners a lot, they came in handy when I read in bed).Second, it has been over four weeks now and my battery finally went under 50%.Other than connecting to the internet to download books, I keep it on airplane mode and the brightness is usually between 3-7. I read 2-5 hours a day, more if I‚Äôm not working or doing anything. The fact that after 4 weeks, I only used half the battery life is fantastic.The page turning and time it takes to load things is far quicker than the previous paperwhite and even a little better than the Oasis.The 8gb is perfect for me. Right now I have 200 books on my kindle and I still have 5.5 gb free (after software the kindle gives you around 6 gb for books, comics, audiobooks, etc).

    I had one of the first gen kindle fires, which was slowing down in responsiveness and I was ready for an upgrade. I decided on a paperwhite as I didn‚Äôt use my fire for anything but reading. The battery life on this device is incredible‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking WEEKS! I love how it feels like I‚Äôm reading a book, its very easy on my eyes, and I can read in bed without disturbing my husband with a bright tablet.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This Kindle Paperwhite is everything that I loved about my older one, which I lost in a dark, muddy, rainy industrial area parking lot at work last week.  Anyway, the unit has more reading surface and is a bit lighter in weight than my old one.  With one touch, this unit linked to my home internet connection, and ALL of my books were already installed.  The only thing that may need improvement, is that the Settings could be easier accessed.  Other than that, this is a great unit

    Heading on vacation and planning to read alot.Much better than packing a dozen or more books, which is what we bought it for.  Good size, adjustable font size and type, adjustable brightness and much more.  Still trying to figure it all out.  Purchased the leather cover which was a good call.  One dislike is the on/off button is at the bottom and if your not careful you can shut it off accidently when reading.  If you read more than 1 book a month it's a good deal purchasing Kindle unlimited.

    Come on Amazon, where is the immersion reading?  As a person with ADHD and a child with ADHD we need immersion reading. Why offer a child's version without this feature too? Just crazy. Avid readers spending tons for a Kindle and ebooks and audiable should be able to use them together like on the app. I bought an eReader to be immersed and can't get the whole package deal, it's either listen OR read? Come on Amazon that's hindering accessibility to people that need it. Other than that HUGE gripe, I love the paperwhite 2021.

    This thing was a nightmare to set up. Wouldn't download my library, wouldn't read things transferred from laptop, wouldn't sync collections. Called and chatted for help several times but the ""customer service"" kept pushing me to the next person. Most likely they had no idea what to do either. Tried questions in the forum but looked like everyone had issues with it. After 2 weeks finally got everything figured out. Took numerous reboots, updating, and cursing. Finally had to send everything one at a time from my account which was a very unpleasant experience.They force you to keep the ""Home"" screen on it which I hate. There was an option to take it off but not after the update. It's nice enough now that it finally works but if the wifi hadn't gone out and the 3G cut off with my last one I would have kept that one and returned this one. The screen does look larger, closer to an actual page. And the battery keeps it's charge pretty well. My last one had started running down more quickly. Do like the ""warmth schedule"" for reading at night. Looks less harsh and doesn't mess with my eyes as much. Overall a really bad beginning that colored my view of this device. Don't know if mine was just messed up or they decided to make these things awful and full of ads as some sort of marketing ploy.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because, I can read in the dark on this kindle. I'm giving it a low rating due to the fact I cannot listen to audible book while reading kindle book at the same time. To some this may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I can read and listen simultaneously on my Samsung phone, iPad, or laptop,(or evev my daughters kindle fire); which leads to the 1st reason for a 2‚òÜ rating. I'm tired of the blue lighting on these devices hurting my eyes, and then evolving into a migraine.2nd, I am dyslexic and sometimes I don't want to deal with my own slow reading. I also have an auditory Processing Disorder, which sometimes make me hear words incorrectly. A lot of time these two learning disability & Disorder go hand in hand. But there are many other people out there with different types of learning styles that would also enjoy reading and listening at the same time. About 10 to12 years ago I had a kindle paperwhite that allowed this feature.3rd, You can only listen to audible book with Bluetooth devices. The old one I had had a speaker in the device for dual use, speaker or headset. So in summary I was very disappointed

    As an previous owner of a Nook and basic Kindle, the new Paperwhite is pound for pound (or dollar for dollar) the best out there right now. Resolution is what you‚Äôd expect on Paperwhite, but the 6.8‚Äù screen really sets it apart from others that typically offer 6‚Äùin that low $109 price point (it‚Äôs already been on sale twice since launch in November 2021, so worth it to wait and not pay retail for it).

    I got this Kindle when my old one was no longer supported. My ~200 books downloaded but the categories were lost, the highlights, the ratings, even whether they were read or not. I called technical assistance and was told I had to download each book again. I actually did that and it did not fix the problem: all the information on over 200 books over 10+ years, gone.  If I want it I have to use my old Kindle. Also just to note the touch screen is too sensitive so the slightest touch turns pages. The buttons were much better. Other than that, the backlit screen is nice.

    This is my 2nd kindle. My first kindle lasted nearly a decade. If finally died and I decided to order a new based on my positive experience. I ordered my new paper white at the end of February 2022. With the advertised long battery life, I erroneously assumed I‚Äôd have this kindle another decade or so. Sadly, now only 4 months later the battery will not charge fully. Yes, I tried various chargers and blocks and it never chargers past 85%. I read daily for about an hour and within 2 days the batteries are completely drained. So we are talking a 2 -3 hour battery life.  I doubt this kindle will last me a decade. This will be my last kindle. Buyer beware.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my third Kindle Paperwhite and, unlike the preceding two, it sucks.Screen responsiveness is sluggish. I often have to tap it repeatedly to turn a page or activate an icon.Books don't automatically download when you purchase them anymore. Only the book cover shows up in your library, and you have to tap on that to initiate the full book download. If you fail to do so, and find yourself somewhere without Internet access, you will be unable to download and read your new books.The ‚ÄúRemove this sample‚Äù option in the book-cover menu seldom works. In order to delete those samples, you have to go to through six screens in Settings to access Manual Removal in Storage Options. Good luck remembering which sample you wanted to delete by the time you get there.‚ÄúRemove download‚Äù used to remove the item from your device. Now, the book cover remains on your device. Downloaded items have check marks to distinguish them from the downloads you removed, but the book covers remain in either case. Now you have books covers for items that aren't downloaded cluttering up your library.The device is too large to fit neatly into my hand like its predecessors did.Two thumbs way down.

    I do not like the new kindle white as compared to my old kindle that will no longer be able to receive new books.  What is wrong with having page turners that you click forward or backward as opposed to touch screen.  I am used to being able to switch hands on my kindle.  Now if I need to turn a page forward with my left hand, I have to cross my body to do so.  And as long as we are on the subject of turning pages, what is with this new kindle white with going either forward or backward several chapters every time you power down.  When you get back to your book, you can't tell where you are.  Plus I used to be able to move my books into different categories, like  Already Read, Good Books, Save for Next Books.  If I add a book to the Already Read category now, it still sits there in my ""Library"".  I do not delete books for any reason although some do end up being archived to Amazon's cloud.  And what is with this nonsense of purchasing a book, but it doesn't download to your kindle.  Instead of downloading a new book, just the title downloads and you have to manually check the internet connection, then check the airplane mode.  Even then any other books you have just purchased do not get downloaded at the same time as the one you are wanting to read.  I think my last rant is the way this thing lists your books.  Either it is a picture with the title and author, or a list with the title and author and some other stuff that just takes up space that I would rather have for the list of my available books to read.  This darn thing downloaded every title I have ever bought.  All 596 of them.  I am sure that most of these were archived.  Is that stupid or what!  What do I like about the kindle white?  I can adjust the size of the letters to what I prefer.  Other than that, I can not find anything else I like about this thing.  oh yes, it also eats my battery power because either I left wi-fi on or I left airplane mode off or some stupid thing.  Don't mess with the old ladies!

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    3 pm today I'm enjoying my Kindle Paperwhite. (Purchased November 25, Today is May 25.) Finished my book and had some other stuff to do so I plugged it in to the charger and walked away. Purchased a new book from my desktop computer around dinner time, but didn't pick up my Kindle again until around 11 pm tonight. Hmm...no new book. Hit the sync button. Still no new book. Hold the power button and wait for the dialogue box to pop up and select ""Restart"". And that's the last thing it ever did.The screen flashes like it's attempting to reboot, but the only thing it displays is the Kindle logo with the boy reading under a tree. Every so often it'll flash again, but it never progresses further. Support tells you to hold the power button down for 40 seconds to force a restart, but there's no different result. Then they tell you to try it again with various options for plugging it in (try a different charger, try a usb port on your computer, nope...plug it back into a wall charger.) Nothing makes it respond differently. I can't even shut it off. There's another review posted by Nishan with a video of the exact same thing happening. Amazon is sending a replacement, but it's going to be a refurbished model which I'm not exactly happy about. It's probably going to be one that somebody sent back that's got the same exact problem.This worked beautifully when it worked. My favorite Kindle by far, and it did respond a lot better than my 2018 version. But if I only get 6 months out of it, it's hardly worth the purchase price and the hassle of needing to return it. If it weren't for my raging insomnia I'd swear off Kindle all together. (Different models, but I've had to replace at least 2 others over the years for weird software/hardware issues similar to this.) Unfortunately, being able to read in the dark without waking up my husband means I'm tied to these.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is much faster than my previous Paperwhite. The page illumination is impressive, very uniform and no bright / dark spots at all. However, while the larger screen is appreciated, the increase in weight is substantial making the device hard to hold in one hand for a longer period. While very long battery life is important for some, it adds a lot of weight. Maybe reducing battery capacity could cut weight somewhat ? Also, holding the device is cumbersome. It is hard to hold on the wider bottom frame section, while side frames are too thin for holding. You need big hands to hold it in one hand. Amazon, just switch to the Oasis design for all of your devices, reduce the price, problem solved.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I am visually impaired, and my present old Kindle has been sadly outdated, so I had to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô.  I chose this paper white as it promoted font changeability and accessibility options. Well, it does offer them but they are not sufficient. The screen size is small (smaller than what I anticipated from the description) the font size does not get very large, certainly not large enough, and the font options are terrible, all with a script, no sans script (which is So much easier to read with vision problems) and they are all hard to read with poor vision.  I am very disappointed, and may have to return.  I will give it a try to see if I can make it work.  I do think it could be a good option for someone else, without visual impairment.  I want my old Kidnle to work!Update:  I wrote the previous in frustration, which I still have, albeit waning.  They do, actually, have sans script but it  (clearly) was hard to tell the difference., and only have a few style options (maybe 8).  Directly following this review, I received a phone call from Amazon. They sent me info on how to change font, etc, which I already had done.  My issue seems to be this: this machine can hold thousands of books which can be downloaded in seconds each, yet the font size only goes up to a small size.  I would think that the font size could be adjusted for those of us with very low vision. In researching this product, i read the font could get ‚Äòhuge‚Äô, a selling point, but no, it can‚Äôt.  Too bad, it‚Äôs an easy thing to fix!  As a person who can no longer read regular books, I am not alone in requiring such technology, and large font is not too much to ask on such items, I do not believe.

    This kindle is decidedly the best one yet. Words are clear, page turns are quick, and the warm light is SO useful. That‚Äôs a good enough reason for me to buy this kindle over the previous generation, even at the markup.The only issue is that taking notes in my kindle is still slow and laggy - reminiscent of my old, 2015 edition of the product. The keyboard is not that responsive and I have to type much slower than usual so the kindle can keep up. This would easily be solved by a faster processor - and I‚Äôm surprised this decision wasn‚Äôt taken.

    The awesome things after upgrading from my 2013: (1) bigger display, (2) warm light and dark mode,  (3) faster page turning, (4) great battery life.Then they push out an update that changes the UI and it now takes 5 clicks to enter dark mode and 5 clicks to turn off dark mode. Really?  Get a user experience expert for review of gui changes please.This should have been a 5 review.

    I am disappointed by the battery life. It doesn't last as long as my last Kindle.  Also, when charging it will only charge to 98%. The screen has frozen multiple times. Extremely disappointed in this newer version.

    I was unaware that a new Kindle was coming so soon and had recently purchased a replacement for my last generation Kindle that started running very slowly. I was able to do a trade in and get a gift card so I upgraded. It was worth it!The battery life is much better than even my Kindle purchased in July. I like the bigger screen and the reaction time is better. The warm light is a great feature for someone like me who hates bright screens and uses all devices on the lowest possible brightness setting.I have had many Kindles and always like to have the most recent one. This was the first one that was actually worth the upgrade.

    Expensive Price Tag for Old Technology
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    It‚Äôs extremely unfortunate that Amazon is charging $120+ for a device that does not offer color and a lagging touch screen. The technology in my 2022 kindle is no different than my kindle from 10 years ago. The touch screen is less than sensitive, lags, and doesn‚Äôt register half the time. Seriously overpriced.

    The next software update may get it another star
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update: I'm taking away one more star, down to 3. The software is worse than I initially thought. Every now and then, when I try to turn the page, it freezes. After a few more tries, 30 seconds later, it unfreezes and reacts to all those page turns, forcing me to go back several pages until I find my place againOverall a very nice reader, nicer than my old Kindle Paperwhite 7th GenerationThey keep advertising ""10 weeks of battery life"", which is meaningless. I wish they advertised how many hours one can read on a battery charge. I see no evidence that the battery lasts longer than the old one, plus it depends on how bright I make the backlight. With the way I have mine set up, I get about 30 hours of readingThey made the display bigger by making the bezel narrower, but that also causes a major problem, at least for me. The way I usually hold it, my fingers are on the back, supporting the weight, and my thumb is on the bezel, providing the balance. With the narrower bezel, this causes inadvertent page turns, which is extremely annoying. The good news is that this problem can probably be fixed through a software update, by adding half an inch of guard band (i.e. a region that ignores finger touches) at the left and right edges (excluding the top corners, which have special functions)

    This is my first Kindle, so no comparisons. Just an evaluation.I like this reader. Compact (hold with one hand), light weight, great resolution, the ligthting is even and adjusts well, the warm color is good for night reading, The responses are fast enough. Basic reading is not a lot of touches/clicks, so response time is fine. (Page turns seem as fast as physical book page turns). Battery life is more than enough.The basic experience is smooth. Pretty well uncluttered. As advertised.Spent extra to not get the ads. And a fabric case. The case feels good.Now it is how it behaves over the long term. No negatives yet.

Lots of customizations in this thing, long battery.Only nit pick is it gets a ton of fingerprints on the back. That hasnt effected my reading experience.

    Extremely disappointed after using my newest model PW for a day. Yes, screen borders smaller but that makes hard to hold w/out accidentally touching edge and fwd/rev page when didnt want to! Have to figure out how many pp it jumped! And w/out the beveled edge, seems nowhere to grip device and it is slippery to slip out of grasp making more likely to drop. I don‚Äôt want a cover and haven‚Äôt needed one w 2 past models (7th gen and PW 7th gen). And the ON button, while located in same place as my prev models, sticks out from edge more and gets pushed w slightest of pressure. Can‚Äôt prop it up for hands free, if holding it ever-so-carefully where you dont accidentally touch borders and skip pages then only place to grip it is about the bottom and the button gets pushed and shuts it off mid-read!!  Gave up reading in bed last night after all the page turns and hand just barely touching the On/Off button too many times. Did not pay extra for Ad Free‚Ä¶it is horrible to pay for something but cant get away from annoying ads. I expect to see the cover of current book when i turn on my kindle, NOT ads for something else. Organization of books is also a negative and awful.  I will be returning this asap‚Ä¶.disappointed. Come on Amazon! This was a big step backwards.

    I wanted to get back into reading so decided to get a Kindle. Started researching the different options, and read rumors of a new device possibly being released soon. Couple days later this one was announced. I immediately pre-ordered it and received it today.After getting it registered and setup, I wanted to remove the special offers. (When I pre-ordered, the ad free version had a delivery date in November, but ad supported version Oct 27th. Weird.) Had a bit of an issue getting them removed, but Amazon customer support got it fixed for me in no time.While going through the settings, I came across a feature I didn't even know was available. Page turn animation. It might use a bit more power, but I love this feature!The lighting is really awesome. With the right combination of brightness and warmth, it looks exactly like the page of a real book. Glad I waited and got this device!

I only need one cable to change all my devices that I carry around. It's great until two of them die at the same time. Which is usually the way it goes. Everyone else can sing the virtues of the rest of the specs. I'm not really happy with the new home screen. I like it simple. My library. And a place to get more books.

The 2021 Paperwhite has much more even lighting, a flush screen, a nice warm light, and the minimal screen size bump makes for more room on the screen for text.  The addition of dark mode is also a nice addition.  The battery life has been great so far.  For the price its a solid deal for those in the Kindle ecosystem.  Would have loved a color eink screen, but it seems that the technology isnt quite there yet.  Will be curious to see how they improve the Oasis now that the Paperwhite has almost identical features (minus the physical keys.)

    Update: shortly after I wrote this I was contacted by CS who truly showed an interest in my complaint. She walked me through a couple of possible fixes which apparently worked.I am impressed with Amazons customer care and happy with my new Kindle.I have used Kindle's for years and thought I would like this new one but I am finding it very frustrating. The page ""turns"" to the next page by touching the screen on either side. So, if I want to advance to the next page, I touch the right side of the screen. The problem is that very often it advances several pages so that I lose my place and I have to backtrack to find the page it should have just turned to.Also, the device just turns itself off at random times while I am reading, even though the battery level shows to be above 80%. At this point I am considering returning the device and reading on my phone.

    Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation issues
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    As a Kindle owner for many years (I‚Äôve had several others before this one.) I must say that the Kindle Paperwhite (11th generation) ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù are not what they should be. Purchased new books and accessing the ones you already have purchased is not the simple task that Kindle is known for. Just holding this version by either side while reading can cause it to flip to other pages than the one you are reading. It is also very easy to turn it off by accident. Another issue comes up if you need to go to another part of a book as the new feature for this does not work very well. I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit with my finger pressed on the spot for an extended time to get it to respond. All in all I‚Äôm wishing I had my old Kindle back.

    New, larger screen size means not having to turn the page as often (and that's a good thing).  The larger screen does not, however, mean that it is heavier to hold (and that, too, is a good thing).  I am so far, very happy with my new Paperwhite.UPDATE: I'm downgrading my original 5 star review to 3 stars.  All of the above remarks still hold true BUT I am now having a huge, annoying problem turning the page. I find that instead of turning to the next page the Kindle, in it's infinite wisdom, will sometimes forward 2 or 3 pages ahead (while with some books this may be a blessing I would like to be the one that makes that choice). I am seriously considering going back to my old, smaller Paperwhite for a less frustrating read!SECOND UPDATE.  The page turning problem has become worse and seriously interrupts the flow while reading.  If I hadn‚Äôt passed the point of no return this sucker would be going back to Amazon .

    Right out of the box, I hate it. I have a 3rd generation Kindle that I bought in 2011 and I have almost 600 books in it. It still works great, the battery charges and lasts for days. All the buttons still work, the screen and cover are in perfect condition. That's 10 great years, and I am an avid reader!So you may wonder why I bought this new Kindle Paperwhite.  Well, I live in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest and the power goes out quite often in the winter. I like to dive under the covers to stay warm and read, but when it gets dark, the old Kindle has no light. That is the one and only reason I got the new Paperwhite; so I can read during power outage.The Paperwhite has a very thin frame so I can't hold it without touching the screen. So that is awkward since I have to move my thumb to read under it.I absolutely hate the touch screen; it is very difficult to navigate and does not always respond when I ""tap"" or ""swipe"" and the screen gets fingerprints and smears. I like the navigation buttons and keyboard on the old Kindle.The Paperwhite will stay in the bedside drawer until the lights go out. It works for that.

    I have owned multiple kindles since 2016. The last one the 10th generation was AWFUL. This model is way better they have seemed to improved all the issues from the 10th generation and it‚Äôs a great kindle so far ! The battery life is pretty good . Reading about 3 hours a day my battery lasts about a week and a half to two weeks. The warm light feature is great as well. So far I have been very happy with this kindle !

    The new 11th Generation Kindle Paperwhite now requires a USB-C cable.  During the ordering, that was never an option, just to add a Power adaptor.I was totally surprised when I went to charge this new Kindle with my previous cable. Nope.  I called Amazon and was told, Yes, they now require a USB-C Cable.  It would have been nice to know that upfront

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I don't know if anyone is even paying attention at Amazon anymore. this is just a 6 inch build with a giant chin. flat screen nice but shows fingerprints and smudges like crazy I'm using a microfiber cloth several times a day to wipe it of. faster page turn then the 10th gen 6 inch yes but not the oasis I bought on ebay for 60 dollars. Battery life is worse the the 10th and 9th gen that you can read 9 or 10 books on I got 7 books out of this new one. you get pop up windows saying application closing or application not working. still the same multi touch operating system that's more of a pain to use then a android tablet with the multi taps to do everything including the book mark. Kobo and nook single tap book mark. I bought my first kindle in 2010 a 3rd gen with keyboard it died last year and I hate all the kindles after the kindle touch because of the cheap build and rotten OS. the thing making this the end for me is the minute plus download speeds of books when nook and kobo take 2 to 3 seconds. I bought a Kobo clara HD 3 weeks ago and between its easy to use picture perfect operating system and in the library section you can hit 3 dots pull up a menu that says download all. Kindle makes my life hard and makes me want to pull my hair out, so I'm going to Kobo where I enjoy  picking up their Reader and using it.  I'm cancelling my kindle unlimited subscription because I don't want anything to do with kindle anymore. evidently some one's more interested in shooting his rear into orbit on a P n s rocket then making sure kindle makes good readers.

    I have Nook and the Kindle 8th generation which both have a frame around with the screen recessed in the center. This Kindle 11th generation is all flat surface like a tablet. I just like it very much. Kindle has smoother and faster page scrolling and turning compared to the nook glowlight which blinks and pauses before it opens, same as their very first e-ink version. I like the amber light in both nook and kindle (and cellphone). I know I bought it brand new, out of a sealed box, but this Kindle sign in asked for a guy's name, as if it was pre-owned. Other than that weirdness, I enjoy it.

    Piece of junk
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is a great reading device - when it works. As a few other reviewers mentioned, it will often freeze up. You get a warning that it‚Äôs going to happen because the page turns get slower and slower; there‚Äôs a palpable and annoying delay before the page finally turns, which then leads to a complete freeze up. There is absolutely no choice except to reboot it entirely. This would be great, but this problem is it‚Äôs fatal flaw.UPDATE:  The very next day after this review was posted, I received a call regarding my negative review from an Amazon Outreach Support Representative. She patiently and professionally guided me through performing a factory reset and creating a new Amazon account. This took awhile due to my continual errors in doing so. The representative was very polite and kind and was dedicated to resolving the problem. Now my PaperWhite is functioning flawlessly. Not only do the pages now turn easily but I noticed that now the battery lasts significantly longer. Thanks to this representative and the now perfect functionality of my Kindle, I find it reasonable to upgrade my review to five stars.Update number 2:  I now must return to my original review. It IS a piece of junk. I was just in the middle of reading a book when the entire screen went blank. I had to restart it twice and went to a different page rather then the page on which I was reading. I would give this one star except that it works most of the time; nevertheless, this is extremely annoying, frustrating, and interferes with the joy of reading. There is no reasonable explanation to why this happens.

    The Machine Is Fine When It Is Not Freezing.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This machine is a very good e-reader, but there is a problem with the hardware/software.  Mine froze in complete nonuse twice.  The second time may be related to new firmware Amazon put out and withdrew.  Amazon acted well in replacing my first reader and is in the process of replacing my second, but this freezing problem has to be resolved if this product is going to be popular with the general consumer, regardless of the large number of good reviews.  Other snags include the invalid certificate box coming up 3 times every time prior to accessing wikipedia and an updating notice every time I access the store.  The machine also slows down sometimes and even more prior to freezing. Amazon's software people need to correct their mistakes.  Once Amazon corrects these problems, this product will deserve five stars.  But when I receive my second replacement, I will, while enjoying my reading, fear a third freeze.  A third freeze and I will suffer post-traumatic stress reading disorder.

    So Not Happy
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After having to send in my older, fully-functional Kindle Paperwhite 2018 to get the 20% trade-in on this new device, I found myself without a Kindle for a little while. So, I was so excited when this finally came today! Especially since when you purchase it, you get 4 months free of Kindle Unlimited. I really wanted to get started reading on the new Kindle and make good use of my subscription.Well, sad day, this is how my Kindle looked when I received it and tried to power it on. I already traded in my old Kindle, have a free Kindle Unlimited subscription, and well, no functional Kindle to read on.I had to spend my free time today contacting Amazon to arrange for a replacement to be sent, and the fastest they can replace this is FIVE more days even with my Prime subscription. So there go another 5 days of not using the Kindle Unlimited or getting the joy of reading a book in the evenings.Oh, and I get to be the one to have to make a trip to UPS to return the non-functional Kindle. How convenient.Apparently, this device is not well-made, and let's just say, I'm not pleased. I wish I had NEVER traded in my older Kindle!UPDATE: They sent me a REFURBISHED Kindle rather than a new replacement. What on earth?????!!!!! I even specifically asked customer service if the replacement would be new rather than refurbished and they promised me it would be new because it arrived not functional and was within the 30-day window. Called customer service and they said they would send a new one, but it was on back order.UPDATE 2 MONTHS AFTER THE LAST UPDATE: Well, received what I thought would finally be my new Kindle after almost 2 months. No joke, another refurbished one. Called customer service again and maybe they will figure this out this time around. How hard is it to get the NEW KINDLE that I paid for???

    Tree Screen...Known Problem...Don't buy!!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I very rarely review products, especially a crappy one. This one however, isn't okay. I bought mine back in January (not even 6 months ago) brand new for $130. I have been a long time Nook user. I've been having an issue with viewing a regular screen so I figured if I was going to purchase an e-reader and not a tablet-esqu one, I might as well go with Amazon for Kindle Unlimited as using my library apps seemed complicated. From the beginning, I had odd issues and just thought it was an inferior product because it was just an e-reader and nothing fancy. Sometimes my books just wouldn't download. No biggie. I then noticed my Kindle quit saving at the right place. Sometimes a page or two behind or sometimes chapters behind. I have the Kindle app on my phone and even though I don't really read on my phone anymore, thought maybe the two were just interfering with each other. I got over it. About two weeks ago, I was trying to download books and I was getting an application error. I thought maybe it was my wifi. I literally just kept figuring it was quirky and an e-reader... Now, last night, I got the page with the tree and person and it literally just keeps rebooting that screen every 15-20 seconds. It's been doing this for the past 24 hours. I can't just hold the button for 45 seconds and looking it up...it appears MANY people have had this issue and it's to do with the software. I did nothing to it. It ""lives"" in the side pocket of my daughter's nursery glider because I read it at night when I'm up with her. From what I read, most people are either offered to buy a new one for like $80 or they are told nothing can be done if there's no warranty. I do not have a warranty but I'm not dishing out another $80 to Amazon for the same product to break again. I'll be calling Customer Service tomorrow but judging from all the forums online, they'll use tech speak and then tell me nothing can be done. Even people WITH a warranty are simply being given refurbished ones after promised a new replacement...some already broken upon arrival. I REALLY expected better from the Kindle line. At this point, I'll take a generic, basic e-reader over taking the chance of this happening again.

    I used Amazon's trade in and got a good price on this Kindle. I upgraded from a 6th generation. My 6th generation was in excellent condition, so I didn't really need a new Kindle but the trade in was a good incentive. I like the larger screen because I read a lot. I like the fact that I can set the warm light to turn on and off at a certain time. I just wish Amazon would come out with a better quality leather cover.

    I got this Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and I was coming from a kindle 8th generation..what an upgrade! I absolutely love this kindle. I was t sure how I would like the backlight. One of the reasons I bought the original kindle was because it read like a book. But not I don‚Äôt know how I ever went without a backlight. You can adjust the brightness and you can also go to warm and dark mode. The battery life is excellent. I also love the flush design and bigger screen. If you are looking to upgrade but are on the fence‚Ä¶just do it. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.

    Hi everyone,so I'm a voracious reader and have at least a thousand books on my kindles.  I actually own 3, all synced together because I travel a ton and keep one in my travel bag. I stays on my nightstand and one is at the office.  All 3 are the paperwhite models.  I really have loved them.  Anyway, I get this model as soon as it came out.  It has some strange hang ups, like when I step away for a bit and it goes into sleep mode or close the cover, and when I return and swipe to turn it on, it goes to a page between 50 and 100 pages back, so then of course I have to search for where I was.  It's extremely annoying and my 2 other kindles have not done this. There is no option that says return to the last page read or something like that.  This is driving me crazy.  Anyway, yesterday it completely froze.  So of course I pushed and held the power button to restart it.  I did this and it came back on eventually but frozen to the scene with the boy reading against the tree.  I can't get past this.  I tried to restart it and it does nothing.  I tried plugging it in to the power cable and still nothing.  It is charged to about 40%.  I called customer service and after about 30 MINUTES trouble shooting,  they said they would process the return and exchange for a new one, but that it would come in 3 days.  I don't understand why the delay.  I'm in the hospital and literally have nothing to do because I only love to read in my free time. I don't watch tv and can't read on my phone for hours because it's not comfortable, which is why I have 3 kindles and also it depletes my phone battery.Anyway, after explaining all this to the rep, they said they would ask a lead about giving me some kind of compensation (anything) because of the inconvenience. He then said he would have to get back to me the next day.  I got an email from amazon regarding the issue but it didn't say anything about the resolution, so I  had to call them again.  And finally they said they can't do anything because they had processed the exchange, as if they were doing me a favor, when it has a year warranty and I got it at the end of october.  Thus it's totally under warranty and therefore they have to replace it because it's defective.  Honestly this whole experience has left me with such a bad taste that I'm actually considering canceling my prime membership.  Stay clear is my recommendation and avoid both Amazon and their products because they are not what they used to be, both in quality and customer service.

I asked customer service to send me one with something to protect the item.If it freezes one more time then I will return it and buying at a physical store.My old kindle that I have had for 2 years never froze.Apart from those 2 negative things, I think it‚Äôs great but I just have a bad feeling that it‚Äôs not that great of a device and will buy insurance. I only bought this because of the dark and yellow light options it has. Other wise I don‚Äôt recommend this new version.

    I‚Äôve had multiple kindle paper whites over the years and while I have loved the convenience of them over having to buy physical books, the screen backlight has always bothered me. The 10th generation was horrible and there was a ton of blue light so reading at night was not the most enjoyable. When I saw this new version coming out, I was excited that it looked like they had finally fixed my number one complaint. This thing is amazing! If you have an old version, it is worth trading in and upgrading if you have a similar complaint. I love that you can adjust the warmth and the screen is slightly bigger as well. So glad I made the switch.

    A couple of steps forward
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have owned two Kindles prior to buying this one: Paperwhite (2015) and Kindle 4. Kindle 4 still remains my favorite all around e-reader. In retrospect, I really liked having a non-touch screen. The downside of Kindle 4 was that it was slow and I couldn't read in the dark. The Paperwhite (2015) was an improvement over that mainly because now I could read in the dark. The touch screen added a bit of ease of use but annoyance with every touch being an interaction. Still, I told myself that if Amazon added warm light and a USB-C to the Paperwhite, I would buy it. So I bought this one.And really, those two features are the two big steps forward for this device. It also feels faster than my Paperwhite 2015 so that doesn't hurt either. The downside for this device is that now with the flush screen and smaller bezels, the touch sensitive area is even bigger. I had too many unintended touches on this device. It's also a little bit bigger; so with small bezels all around, it's just generally less uncomfortable to hold. This was the least comfortable kindle I have had.I also typically keep my device on airplane mode unless I need to connect to my Amazon account. This device froze frequently while I was reading. I suspect this has to do with telemetry and ads being pulled to the device. In airplane mode, the device just freezes and lags if it can't communicate with Amazon servers. This is just my guess but I have seen this behavior in games in both iOS and Android platforms where if you block their access to the internet, the games lags heavily and once you restore internet access, the game play is smooth again.So generally, this is a good step forward for Amazon. I suspect that Amazon is expanding its ads business and the integration of that into the kindle OS is causing lags on the device when in airplane mode. That's definitely a step backwards. Add to that a bigger device that is less comfortable to hold and the choice was clear for me.I am sending this device back and keeping my Paperwhite 2015.

    This is a pretty nice improvement on size and screen quality over the earlier model. If you have the one before it, you probably don‚Äôt need this one but you certainly will notice the upgrade. It also has night time lighting. Go with the 8 gig and not the 32 gig unless you just have to listen to audio books from your kindle. Your smartphone is usually a much better option for audio books.

Its easy to read while walking on the treadmill.  With the Libby app, its so easy to download books from the library.  Keeps you place in the book between reading sessions.

    A great update marred by a soft/fuzzy screen
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    While this Kindle Paperwhite 2021 finally brings a whole host of long needed improvements, the likes of which competitor Kobo has offered for years and at various price points, it‚Äôs not without its flaws.For starters the overall footprint of the device has increased despite room enough to fit the larger 6.8‚Äù display within the footprint of the former body. While it‚Äôs not a deal breaker it hurts portability and single-hand use that little bit. The latter is especially noticeable because, unlike it‚Äôs pricier sibling the Oasis, it lacks an asymmetric grip and page turn buttons.While the resolution of the new display is the same 300 PPI, I encountered noteworthy issues with display sharpness when compared to the 2018 model. As pictured (to the best of my ability) my new model lacks sharpness and contrast all around the edges and in particular on the left side which results in a soft almost fuzzy lack of crispness to all text or images.To make matters worse the consistency of this issue varies wildly across the display. In the image you can almost make out the random diagonal plane of sharpness towards the center of the display. This means that you find yourself consistently reminded how soft the fuzzy portions are compared to the properly sharp portions.I‚Äôm thrilled to see Amazon finally include USB-C and warm-light adjustment, but I find it especially hard to look past the display issues on a device expressly built for reading. If you have the previous generation Kindle Paperwhite or Oasis I‚Äôd recommend holding off for now or consider a Kobo equivalent model with native OverDrive support for library borrowing.

    Frustrates Reading
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Feels like I'm reading through a foggy haze. The text is not crisp, the brightest color is too ""warm,"" and for indoors reading the Paperwhite is greatly inferior to a tablet or, for that matter, a smart phone. Reading outdoors on a bright day, however, it truly has no equal.The design engineers must have failed to try it out before production, because if one tries to hold the Paperwhite with one hand, while reading, you soon discover you frequently touch the power button and turn off your reader. The button should have been located on the top or upper side of the device.When holding the device with one hand, and advancing the pages using a thumb swipe, the book will skip backwards three pages. Whereas this doesn't happen too frequently, it does happen often enough to be extremely annoying.The two outstanding features of the Paperwhite are its long battery life and bright light functionality. It flat blows away the other e-reader devices in those two areas.Bottom line - I wouldn't recommend buying the Kindle Paperwhite unless you do a lot of reading outside in bright sunlight and/or read for hours at a time and don't want to keep your tablet/smart phone plugged in to the charger.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Almost loved it. I thought that this would probably be one of the best iterations of the Paperwhite ever. I had the 2012/2013 version and loved that one! I had it by my side all the time, used it for years without issue (though I will admit it did lag occasionally). But this new one, despite its glowing features that led me to buy it, including the warm light and waterproof/water resistant nature (not that this second feature matters -- because my old Kindle Paperwhite and my standard Kindle handle splashes just fine), was an utter disappointment. I bought it mainly for the warm light feature so that reading before bed doesn't disrupt sleep quite as much, but given that I have bought it for such a feature, it had limited use (staying in the bedroom and only used for times when I read immediately before bed). Well, I bought it in October, only finished a grand-total of one full novel on it and only used it for roughly a hand-full of times, and it already has an issue. Stuck on the boot screen, unable to fully boot in or turn off (holding the power button for however long (40 seconds, 5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) doesn't work, neither does charging). The customer service is okay... if you get the right person... but to be honest, at this point, I feel that the replacement device isn't worth my time. I am not looking forward to dealing with the problem a second time and I can read hours before sleep instead with much more reliable Kindles.Do not recommend.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm a pretty avid reader and I didn't hesitate to buy the Voyage when it came out But for the first time in 10 years of reading on kindles, I'm considering a return. The device is great, don't get me wrong. The material its made of makes holding it feel natural, the screen is excellent (although the voyage remains the sharpest screen to date) and I enjoy the size increase. But many small things have just come together to really annoy me.For starters, the device freezes on a regular basis usually after adjusting font/brightness and returning to the book. Sometimes it unfreezes after a bout 20 seconds sometimes it never does. I've had the device a few days but its happened almost a dozen times. I thought my issues would be over when I updated the firmware but that not only didnt help, but introduced a new bug where the backlight does not turn off when locking the device, and made some nonsense changes to the interface. List view went from 7-8 books to 5. For those with a big library, that makes it very painful to view everything (and nothing has been added to the value of the list view, same data just unnecessarily bigger. Why not leave the option for fitting more books in the list?)The power button is on the bottom. I've accidentally turned my device off while reading many times considering that the larger form factor requires cradling on my fingers at times. Curious placement. I've tried to remove special offers but for three days now it just says ""sorry something went wrong, please try again later"". My kindle is a place where I go to get away from everything else, not be advertised to. After this bug I researched the issue and other people are being told that they aren't allowed to remove ads. That's disappointing.I know it sounds nitpicky, but a great device has just been crippled with strange bugs, unusual design choices and software updates that don't really add value and seem to just be changing things for the sake of changing things, or changing things for the wrong reasons. For the first time in my life after owning kindles for ten years, I'm considering returning it.

    I got the newest (11th Gen) paperwhite to upgrade from my older (2014) paperwhite.  I like the display and ability to have warmer light.However if I do not use the device for several hours it seems to go into deep sleep and it takes about 3s to wake up (displays a message that it is starting up) before I get the ""swipe to unlock"" message, whereas the older device started within 1s. In addition, the new device appears to have a shorter battery life that the old one (even after 7 years of use...)Finally the new device sometime skips pages when I swipe to go to the next page, which is not a problem I ever had with the older device.In all the new device is nice, display and background light warmth is improved, but it may be trying to be too smart and do too much, which leads to usability glitches that make me rate it only 3 stars.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    For those of us with poor vision, the ability to increase the font size makes the Kindle indispensable.  There's just one problem: this applies only to the contents of the e-books themselves, so it can still be hard to navigate the system to do things like search your library, or change a Kindle setting.or read a book review, for example.  This is why I took a star away from ""Easy to read.""  I would urge the designers to address this accessibility issue.  It doesn't seem that difficult.

    I do most of my reading in bed in a very dark room to help me sleep.  I tried all of the brightness, font, warmth settings I could, as well as dark mode, but I couldn't find a decent configuration that was comfortable.  The dark mode has a gray background and text that isn't bright enough which leads to terrible contrast.  And the only way to get decent contrast with the normal/light mode was to turn the brightness up to a setting that is uncomfortable for my eyes.This reader is okay if you plan to read in normal lighting but I do not recommend for dark rooms.  My android phone with a Kindle app, black page color, and eye comfort shield is vastly superior and more comfortable on my eyes.

The touchscreen still isn't on par with that of a phone or tablet, but the amount of unregistered taps has been reduced, and the accuracy of selecting text is much better. I read a lot at night in the dark, so the warm light is what I notice most. I have much less eye fatigue when comparing the warm yellow light of this new paperwhite to the whitish blue light of the old.

    The buggiest Kindle ever!
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This Kindle drives me crazy. It freezes so I can't turn pages at least once or twice a day (I read maybe 3 hours a day) and has to be rebooted in order to function again, which takes maybe 5 minutes each time.. Sometimes when I go to the top to get a menu, it does not work, or the menu comes up but menu items such as table of contents will not come up or only come up after being touched 5 or 6 times and after a delay of a minute or so. Frequently after I close down and come back later the display will be not where I left off but a couple of chapters or more behind where I left off and I have to hunt for my current location (not easy when I can't get the table of contents to display either).I only bought this Kindle because my old paperwhite would no longer hold a charge, but I sadly miss my old reader. It had none of these problems and gave me many happy, trouble-free hours of reading. This new one is so SO much inferior in almost every way. This current one is called 11th generation Paperwhite, Firmware Version 5.14.1.1. I do not recommend it!

    Power button placement is idiotic
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    You will occasionally and accidentally turn the Kindle off in the middle of reading if you:- rest the device against a table- rest it against a belt buckle or a shirt button- place it on a stand- move a finger along the bottom- change your grip by supporting the bottom of the device- etc.This is such an elementary issue, I can only imagine how embarrassed the Paperwhite product manager must be for not user testing the device enough in real life contexts.Other than this obvious oversight it's a great device. The screen is beautiful. However, I'm returning mine due to the design problem. It's also slower to wake up than my Kindle Voyage, which I'll stick to for now (I've never before seen a Kindle that tells the user ""Waking up..."" when swiping to open it -- odd 1-2 seconds of extra sluggishness there).

    Don't like anything about new Paperwhite...VERY disappointed
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After many years of being satisfied with my Nook tablet, I was excited to purchase the newest Kindle Paperwhite in order to get Amazon e-reader books.  I'm so disappointed that I wasted my money.  It's hard to navigate, it's touchy, the screen always seems blurry no matter what light setting I put it on, and I absolutely loathe the gray and white (not black and white) pictures of the books.  They are not clear and difficult to see.  Until I can be convinced that there are better Kindles, I'll stick with my ancient tablet.

    Very disappointing
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù light is the most ridiculous and irritating feature to be put on this reader.  It constantly turns itself from black and white to yellow and has to be adjusted, often multiple times to return it to black and white. Why would whoever designed this think anyone would want to read on a yellow background?  Additionally, when you purchase or borrow a book it does not show up automatically in the library as it used to.  You now have to make sure you remember or make a note of the name and ‚Äúsearch Kindle‚Äù for it.  Expected my new Paperwhite would have improvements but disappointed in this expectation.  Would definitely not buy this Paperwhite again!

    It's a well buily e-reader. But I still don't like how much empty space Kindle leaves around each word. It's a small screen be compact.The usability is awful. Too many buttons and unnecessary options/gestures. I want a clean reading experience as much as possible, a book. Not a eink tablet. Don't try to be fancy. Also Kindle seems try to lure you to their store as much as possible. Please allow users to hide store search bars and etc. Also please allow show books by list instead of their covers.  If not for the Kindle book store I would easily switch back to Kobo. Kobo is much cleaner.Oh please support epub.Battery life felt smaller than my kindle gen 2 or 3. But this is subjective.

    Great looking Kindle with serious reliability issues
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Quick summary: This Kindle provides a lovely reading experience, but has software issues; I'm on my second replacement.I‚Äôve been reading on Kindles since 2009. The 6.8"" version of the Kindle Paperwhite is my 4th Kindle, so I typically have Kindles them for about 2-3 years before getting sucked in by a shiny new model. Usually, my old Kindle is still functioning fine at that point, and I hand it down to one of my kids.The 6.8‚Äù Kindle paperwhite has been a stark departure from the reliability I‚Äôm used to. I received one as a Christmas gift in 2021, and was initially very happy. I love the design updates, the wider screen, and the warmth screen features. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the size (a little too big to hold comfortably), but that problem is easily solved with a case or a pop socket.After about two months of reading, my book froze. I went to the home screen to discover my library had disappeared (still in Amazon, just gone from the Kindle). I attempted to reboot, and the Kindle got stuck in an endless reboot cycle. It would load up to the screen with the tree, freeze (it never showed the progress bar), shut itself off, and try to restart again‚Ä¶ until the battery ran out.I called Amazon customer service in late February and had outstanding help. I returned my broken Kindle, received a replacement, and was once again happily reading. The replacement worked for about 1.5 months until one night my book froze and‚Ä¶ I had another endlessly rebooting Kindle. The exact same problem.I contacted customer service again in May and asked to return the Kindle, planning to buy an older model with the refund. I was told I was out of the 30 day return window, and all they could offer was a replacement.I appreciate the second replacement, which is on its way, but now every time I‚Äôm reading I‚Äôll be wondering if this is the day my book freezes and I'm on the phone with customer service again...

    This is an amazing tool for my son who loves to read.  I wanted to give him unfettered access to books with out the internet and traditional tablet apps.  he needs access to books beyond Harry Potter or kids books. I removed the web browser and gave him the device with the ability to download what ever books he wanted. That was A mistake. He rented pornographic comics and books.  I wish I could restrict access to pornography but still let him access Everything else. In the mean time I have locked down access to all on the Kindle content and we spend time choosing books together to download.  One other unfortunate side effect is the platform now keeps suggesting inappropriate content.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    There is apparently no way to NOT see other household member audible books in your library. That means that you have potentially tons of books that you need to scroll through to find the one you want, because you cannot remove anything from a family household, nor sort anything.Update: Looks like there is a way, but if sharing was enabled prior to getting your kindle, disabling sharing is not sufficient. You need to completely delete title by title, disable family sharing, leave the household, then re-join the household, reset the kindle and re-login.Thats 2 hours of my life I won't get back.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I traded in my Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen for a new 2021 Paperwhite model due to my older model battery starting to need more frequent charges.I found that the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite was a little too large and heavy for comfort.  I purchased as light a case as possible, but it still was more of a challenge for my arthritic hands.  I also found that the page responsiveness was not as good as advertised. I missed my smaller, older 7th Gen model.A recommendation to Amazon - for your slightly older Paperwhite customers - keep the size and weight of your product smaller, please.  The regular Kindle is smaller, but the benefits of the Paperwhite are attractive to alot of customers.

    *EDITED* to add that as of yesterday, the Kindle no longer functions. It seems to have tried to install an update, and is now stuck on the ‚ÄúKindle‚Äù Home Screen with the logo, and every attempt to hard restart the device only results in a cycling of the Home Screen. I‚Äôm not able to unlock it or do anything else with it. Thankfully, Amazon warranty has promised to send me a new device, so here‚Äôs to hoping that the Kindle I received was simply bugged out and the replacement works as promised.This gist: the Kindle Paperwhite has done everything I would expect a ""basic"" Kindle to do, but isn't worth the extra money.Pros: I can read e-books, which saves me money and space in my apartment.Cons:- the pages turn in flickers/flashes, and only sometimes land me on the next or previous page- the transition from light to dark mode is discombobulating, with another series of flickers or flashes and sometimes freezing on the drop down menu- I have yet to experience the battery life lasting past a week, let alone the promised 10 weeks- recently, when I try to resume reading, the Kindle drops me to a random spot in the book rather than resuming where I left offNot impressed, and I will be seeking to replace the Kindle with the basic version to save myself money and expectations.

So I arranged for another trade in. When they returned the kindle to me they did so with an adapter and cord, that were not mine. I included a note stating that fact. I just checked my account and they dropped the value from 20$ to 15$/working. Like I said above you can actually resell mine as new. No scratches no issues it was in mint condition.The new kindle:I am having a hard time with the lack of sensitivity to touch. Not as responsive as my previous. Battery life is not as indicated.

    I was extremely excited for a new Kindle and have been waiting for a month+.  However, the upgrade was not worth it and I returned.  I had an older Kindle Paper White that I love and will keep using.  Here were some of the reasons for return:1)  The wider screen, even while minimal, made it very uncomfortable to hold with one hand2)  I could see shadows from the previous page after a turn3)  The brightness just seemed off.  I could not get it to be on the perfect setting where it was crisp and visible without looking like a normal tablet4)  The menu configuration made it multiple clicks/swipes to get to brightness vs. the older model where one push gets you there.

    Firstly, the matt screen works well for readability. Glare is significantly reduced from my other Kindles (I have 7). However, the placement of the control buttons and charging port on the bottom is just stupid. It means anytime I try to stand it on a reading support, it wants to shut down or reset. Also when stood vertically, the charging port is inaccessible. Too, many of the touch screen motions are different than all other Kindles - WHY??? I enjoy reading outdoors, so to that end, the paperwhite is an upgrade. I really want to like it, but except for outdoor reading, I simply cannot.

    This Kindle is light and fast and the page warmth is a great touch. Some reviewers have lamented the long wake up time. Since I'm probably not going to use it as an emergency medical device or a defensive weapon during a surprise ambush I think waiting 10 seconds to read is ok.

    Slow and glitchy and disconnects from wifi
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I find that it is very slow and doesn‚Äôt always respond to what I try to do. I sometimes have to click five times to open a book. It looks like it‚Äôs loading then it stops.  Sometimes when I go to the next page it will jump forward or backwards multiple pages, or it will go back and fourth between the same two pages while I‚Äôm trying to move forward.  It also is constantly disconnecting from the Wi-Fi and takes a bunch of tries to reconnect.  When it is working it is nice, but I feel like I could have just used my phone and saved the money.

    Coming from a 1st edition paperwhite, I couldn‚Äôt be more impressed. The $25 trade-in credit + 20% off + 4 free months of my current Kindle Unlimited subscription saved me nearly $100. The new Paperwhite screen is crystal clear and very responsive. The addition of the new warm amber lights is awesome, especially if you like to read before bed to help you fall asleep. Battery life is nice too, currently at 72% after 2 weeks of everyday for a few hours.

    I usually read in Dark Mode, but the white letters were not bright enough for comfortable reading.  The Black and White screen had a lot of grey which made a lot of the titles on the books VERY difficult to read.

    This definitely lives up to the advertised improvements compared to the previous Paperwhite. It responds much faster to input, the bigger screen is great and looks great; it now can display as much text on a page as a typical paperback. Battery life seems better too.

    Frozen screen, customer service
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased this paper white 2021 early December. I like it at first, because I can read at bed without disturb my wife. But after three weeks the screen got frozen. I called customer service then they put me on the rotation pick up call. I had to explain my issue multiple times, and tried multiple ways to solve the frozen issue. I followed the instructions to reset/hard reset many times, but the issue remained. Finally, customer service agreed to replace it. After two weeks, I am still waiting the replacement paperwhite. I don't know when I can it and customer service won't give me a n answer. It is very disappointed.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my 3rd or 4th Kindle Paperwhite.  I loved the first two, but sadly I think this one is a big step backwards.  True, it has a bigger screen in a ""container"" of the same size, BUT the way that is achieved leaves so little border that I frequently find myself inadvertently changing pages backward and forwards OR even turning it off.  I've tried lots of adjustments over the 3+ months that I've had it, but none work.  Amazon has simply crowded too much into a small space.  Also, I can no longer have the time of day show at the top of the screen all the timeVery disappointed.

    I LOVE kindles, and this one is no exception. The warm light is in the pictures as yellow, but it also goes the other way to an ice blue! And the touch response is miles better than the older kindle, a tap is almost instantly registered.If you are on the fence- just try it! You have my permission and recommendation!

    Screen is very slow response
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I asked for a new Paperwhite for Christmas because I noticed a slowdown in screen response. I also wanted waterproof. My old one still functions very well otherwise, and I may go back to it, because the brand new, updated Paperwhite is so... much... slower. It takes a long time to wake up. It takes a long time to enter my passcode. It takes AGES to write a brief note. It's insane. And the battery life is not really better, either. I'm incredibly disappointed with this item, since my other one is about 6 years old. I expected vast improvement in the technology. But other than supposedly being waterproof, it's actually much worse.

    You breathe, it scratches
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve had this for four days, used for probably two hours total, and it has these scratches that really bother me and distract me from reading. Tried to contact support for an exchange and they would not do that. It‚Äôs decent to read on, but it obviously is not going to hold up even under gentle use. I bought on sale so was hoping I could exchange, but now I will just be retuning and not purchasing a new one. Edit: I was not happy with the return options and am still very sad Amazon would not allow me a new kindle at the same price I had paid. However I decided that rather than be without a reading device, or pay significantly more than I did, I would keep this one. I put a matte screen cover on it which does diminish the screen resolution, but I can‚Äôt see the scratches. It will do well enough. Still, overall would not recommend for the cost.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have a beloved fifth generation  Kindle that has seen more than it's share of books. Receiving notice it would no longer be updated with new software and security, I purchased this one which arrived the day it was released. Big mistake. I had to update the software as soon as I received it.I downloaded a few books in my library for a plane trip - they would not open on the airplane & I kept getting a message I needed to sign into Wi-Fi. Why? The books were already downloaded.When I got to my destination I was able to open a book. For some annoying reason the word ""highlights"" appeared over certain sentences. Where they came from & how to remove them was a complete mystery until I read a review here from Sarah. After following her instructions I was able to get rid of highlights that others reading the same book had placed. Why would I want to see others highlights, Amazon?  Even worse, it appears this procedure will have to be done for each book. Why should I have to edit highlights out of my books?Further, I sorted the books in my 5th Gen nto categories, making them easy to locate when I wanted to read a certain genre. Where did they go? Why didn't they transfer somewhere I could find them?So many reviewers are mentioning warmth, display, brightness, etc., as problems. All I want is to be able to find the books I already had in my library. And I want them in the way I sorted them, not the way Amazon is now presenting them, which is by series.I don't like this Kindle and am feeling the same way about Amazon.

    i purchased this device a couple of months and I must say the battery life and reading quality are second to none. However the internet access is pathetic.

    A step backwards for E-ink technology, low contrast
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I really like the size of this new device, it‚Äôs really light and the back light is very bright.  But this is where the pros stop for me. I currently use a 2014 paper white and wanted to get this new 2021 upgraded unit. However, I find this new unit has a very soft almost fuzzy screen.  The contrast, between the black letters and book covers and the bright white background is low, soft and bland. The letters should POP! But they don‚Äôt!E-ink technology is getting worse, the letters on my older model are so sharp, crisp and clear and look like they‚Äôre almost floating on the background. On this new model they more or less just blend in with the fuzzy background. I‚Äôve read that is because they made the screen flush on this model and that involves adding more layers of plastic which dull the contrast.It‚Äôs a real shame that people new to E-readers think that this is a such great device. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it has some great attributes, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all about the display quality and when you have something to compare it with, this new model doesn‚Äôt deliver.New Paperwhite on left and old 2014 on right, same font and lighting settings, unfortunately the picture doesn‚Äôt really come through well.I ended up with a Kobo Libra 2, the screen contrast is brilliant and I like the software better than kindle

    I will update my review once my fianc√© opens it up and uses it. I bought this as one of his Christmas/Birthday gifts because he has been talking about getting one for a while now. I'm appalled at how this gift was packaged. I don't have a lot of money and this wasn't cheap, so I expected it to be protected....Whoever packaged this Kindle put it in a box with nothing else!!! There was zero protection. I could have a Kindle that doesn't start or work properly because it was being banged around in a box. I could also be overreacting, but this is a gift and I paid good money for it to be functional.Keeping my fingers crossed for no issues.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My Kindle Fire will not hold a charge anymore, so I started looking for a replacement. I read many reviews of how much people loved their paper white so I decided to give it a try. I researched it before buying it and thought I would like it since it is glare free, even though it had less features than my Fire. I was wrong. I miss the scroll page option and text to speech. I also need big letters to see and since the screen is so small, it seems like I have to click to turn the page constantly. I kept it too long past the return window thinking it would just take time to get used to it. I wish I had saved the money, and just bought another fire. It just isn‚Äôt the right book for me.

Which I wasn‚Äôt doing before cause I don‚Äôt like reading on my phone or iPad screen.However, it just stopped working. I got it in February and it is now may. It just acts like it‚Äôll load but it never comes off the loading screen. I let it die thinking if I did that and then plugged it in and left it alone it would work again. Essentially unplug it and then plug it back in again. Nope. Still just stuck on the loading screen. Waste of more than $100. I‚Äôm so upset üò≠üò≠üò≠

    When it works, I love this Kindle. The lightweight device is nice in hand. The screen brightness can be adjusted to a comfortable level. Overall, I liked it... when it was workingThe Kindle would freeze and stop working entirely. This first happened four days after I got the new release. Amazon Support was great and sent a new one. After 30 days, the second one had the same issue. The screen would stop on the loading screen and nothing more would happen. I went through all the steps Amazon Support recommends, and still nothing. The Kindle is essentially dead when stuck on the loading screen.The ordeal to get a replacement for the a second one was a month-long nightmare. I spoke with Support multiple times regarding my replacement. I had already sent in the original, malfunctioning drvice after being told I wouldn't get a replacement until I sent it in.Every representative I talked to said the new one would ship, that it was in the advanced stages of shipping and couldn't be cancelled. Finally, after speaking with 10 different reps, over the course of two weeks, I got a refund. I don't know if I'll get a new Kindle Paperwhite or just let it go.

So disappointed in this kindle especially for the price.  UPDATE: An Amazon Representative contacted me about the issues I was having with my kindle paperwhite e reader. Amazon replaced my glitchy kindle with a new one. All I needed to do was return the original kindle to them. The replacement kindle is working fine so.

    New paperwhite is junk
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had numerous kindles and I've loved them.  My earlier generation paperwhites worked wonderfully and still do. I actually only bought  a new one for the bigger screen and because I had chipped the older one and was worried it wasn't waterproof anymore.I've had 2 new 6.8"" paperwhites in last 6 months.  Both of them were glitchy, touch sensing would start to go, they would randomly forget my place in a book, the UX started getting all weird and the store wouldn't load.  In both cases, I attempted to reboot them to fix the software issues and both times, they never stopped rebooting.  They just rebooted themselves over and over until their batteries ultimately dies.To add insult to injury, in both cases, Amazon support also would not honor the return.  They said the return period closed.  I had to fight for hours with Amazon support to get a refund under the "" 1 year warranty"" and even then it wasn't a full refund.  They made me purchase  a new one (at a newer, higher price) and then made me call back to get the original refunded at the lower purchase price.  I was out an additional $35 and a month later still had  a second broken kindle.Again - I love the original paperwhite's but these new ones are junk and Amazon wont help you when they fail in  a month.  I wish I was wrong, because I just want a working paperwhite.

    Awful! Amazon has sent me 3 and they all malfunction
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve gotten 3, so far, from Amazon and they all malfunction and stop working in under two weeks.  They first try to send you a refurbished one but that ones already directive. We had to call and complain non stop for a refund just so we could purchase a new one without previously known issues‚Ä¶ otherwise they were just going to send me another refurbished one which the rep said would probably have problems. They supposedly noted our account several times about ‚Äúthe plan‚Äù. ( the plan being they would credit us a gift card to buy a new one after receiving the ones we sent them ) After sending back the first two we had to literally fight for WEEKS to get a gift card refund so we could get the new one. They didn‚Äôt automatically credit me.  We were still paying for the service but with no tablet. They apparently couldn‚Äôt tell it was sent back until we complained to several reps. It was never going to be credited. This was a nightmare. We got the 3rd tablet Monday and it‚Äôs Thursday today. It‚Äôs already malfunctioning. I would not recommend this product or recommend depending on Amazon to follow through with what they agreed to do.  We had to fight so hard just get get our money back in the form of a gift card just to get another defective product.

    I have been a Kindle user and advocate since the first Kindle Reader.  As each of my Kindles ""died"" I purchased the next Kindle edition. My son gave me the current version circa 2021. The screen quality excellent. However, the user interface is complicated. Indeed, I have found impossible when I purchase a new book and then attempt to sycn/download onto my Kindle. When downloading a book, the synching option is buried in some interface which is completely user unfriendly. Kindle was a simple product and device. The geeks have created a completely user-unfriendly product. Amazon, I ask that you return to the elegance of previous products. This one is impossible. I will seek alternatives including hardcopy purchases not through Amazon.

Will try for a couple weeks but not impressed so far.Update 03/03/22_Discovered a bad screen pixel. Returning and will continue to use my current Kindle.

    The screen is outstanding and the size is a nice compared to larger tablets (i.e., 8"" or bigger). It is easy to hold and read, yet still small enough to carry in a pocket. The software has evolved to be flexible and easy to use. This is great for. reading outside in daylight, yet still illuminated for darker conditions.

    THIS IS A 2-FOLD REVIEW!! The Paperwhite I bought, $139.00, then insurance was NOT GOOD. Just like the customer service I got on it.  Paperwhite was nice and light, when it worked it worked but not great, but ok!  I made 4 different phone calls to tell them my paperwhite I ordered on Nov. 28th and got a couple days later had quit working!! It worked 3 quarters of the way for 3 months! The Insurance phone number got me nothing, but line drop after about 5 min of talking to them. The Amazon Customer service sucks. 1st call, gentleman was so nice, no problem, would send me a new one in two days and instructions to return one not working. Then an email, a delay in shipping and I would be notified of new shipping date! NOTHING, waited, called 2nd time, got a gentleman that was nasty!! Could or would not give me a new shipping date said I would get an e-mail with that on it!! Never came, only another one e-mail telling me I would get another e-mail!!!!  Third call to Insurance, got a nice lady was trying to help me after 15 min we got cut off, not call back! Called a 4th time, Amazon, talked to gentleman that was very nice, I was not, I ask to speak to supervisor, never got to. This guy had me place a new order, (CHARGED TO MY ACCOUNT) told me they would refund it when I sent back the one not working!!!! Will see! Will back and by a Kindle or another reader somewhere else, NOT AMAZON!!  THIS PLACE HAS GOTTEN TO BIG FOR IT'S SELF.

    The hardware works well. Easy to read. Pages flip reasonably quickly.  The user interface is painful.  The designers should not be shot but a little mild torture would not be out of line.  Where is the download for my 1000 books on the Amazon cloud? Why can't I see the lists of books so I can quickly find the one I want? Where is the LOCAL search?  I don't want JUST a seach of all books on Amazon.  I probably won't return the kindle but its painful enough to use that it will be relegated to the bathroom.

    So far, not impressed. My 2014 Kindle still works mostly fine, but I wanted to upgrade due to a few minor hiccups and wanting more features. I didn't have the cover option, updated the software on my fresh-from-the-box Paperwhite 11th Gen, and now I'm getting ads; when I try to turn them off in Amazon content & devices, it throws an error. I have no option to view the book cover, and I can't NOT see reading lists and recommendations on the home screen.I paid for zero ads, and one update later, and I'm seeing ads--and, of course, Amazon's help section is giving me the runaround so I can't even troubleshoot.

    I purchased this assuming it would work with Hoopla from the library like other Kindles do.  Unfortunately, it does not support and Android Apps so it will not work with Hoopla or most other Apps.  I went ahead and did the free trial for Kindle Unlimited which it says also even includes audiobooks.  Literally searched my 10 favorite authors and none of them are included nor any books I was intending to read so it's not really unlimited anything.  Even the books that are there and included, the audio is extra, so this all really just feels like a big money grab from Amazon forcing us all to read only their content.  Also, the touch screen is also extremely slow to respond so you'll think it's frozen but really it's just lagging.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have been an owner of Kindles since 2011 with hundreds of hours of reading. Kindle was a pleasure to own because I could adjust the size of the font and the boldness of the print. I have severe eye problems and Kindle allowed me to continue reading. In 2021 I received a notice from Amazon that Kindle was being replaced with an upgrade. On October 23, 2021 I ordered two new Kindles. From the beginning the page was very sensitive and would flip back and forth. So when opening I never knew what page it would be on. Usually it was just a few pages either back or forward. Frustrating, but I learned to live with it. Then it progressed to only opening at the beginning of the last time I opened the Kindle. Example: yesterday I started reading at 17% and read to 23%. When I opened the Kindle today it opened back at 17%. It got worse. I have been reading a series. I am now on book 2. When opening Kindle it opened in book 1 at page 8. Also the font was changed. I tried ""settings"" but could not access it. I tried different things, then finally had to re-boot Kindle. I have wasted so much time trying to find where I left off it has taken so  much joy out of reading. I would not recommend your ""new and Improved"" Kindle to anyone. What a rip-off. Signed a very frustrated owner of Kindle.

But also to read books for as long as I can. I am disabled (can't walk, on oxygen all the time, etc) and almost don't get out of my house due to my bad health.

    I loved being able to read in the sun, and also not have to worry about it getting wet. I hate the buggy browser. Response time is also unbearably slow. In the past I‚Äôve read ebooks on the Kindle app on my iPad. The iPad interface is much better. I was surprised to see that the actual Kindle was much less functional and extremely user-unfriendly. For example, when reading a book on my iPad, I can easily scroll through Notes and Highlights, but the Paperwhite only scrolls one note at a time, is unbearably slow, and the scroll bar doesn‚Äôt work at all. I will keep this Kindle for checking out library books to read on the boat, but I won‚Äôt be using it for any academic reading.

    Customer support was helpful and kind. Helpful in terms of just using the warranty. I was basically told that it shouldn't have battery issues this early. After googling the issue, I found that this is a pretty common occurrence. Don't let your battery die and don't go long periods of time not using the kindle!Especially once the warranty ends, because they will just give you a 15% off coupon for a new kindle. This seems like a known issue with Amazon! Definitely worried for after the warranty, but I honestly had the best time reading for the 4 days it was working fine.No amount of charging or button pressing is saving this kindle.People even suggested throwing it in a freezer. I did it out of desperation and a last resort, but still nothing.Apparently this flickering (like when you turn a page), is normal for the type of screen that's used. It means the screen is changing. So my screen is TRYING to change from the tree screen I guess, but reverts back to it no matter what I do.

    I was giving a Kindle for Christmas last year. I absolutely loved it. Battery, while on the annoying ad screensaver lasts days, I'd even say maybe 2 weeks. Aside from the touchscreen being wonky, it was good. Until my wifi is out due to an outage and I want to read until everything is working again. You can't read downloaded books without wifi? Why can't it fully download the first time and be readable WITHOUT wifi? The older versions of Kindle let you fully download books and read with or without wifi, so why can't the assumably better next gen do the same? Am I missing a setting or something? It's ridiculous and disappointing because if I ever travel, I can't bring this with on a plane.

    Ok, I've had a kindle since the keyboard one (when they first came out), then I got a paperwhite, and now this one.  I am a HUGE kindle fan and have read hundreds of books on them, maybe even over a thousand.  I am so disappointed in this one.  The paperwhite was great, but my puppy hit the screen with one of her nails and caused a bright spot... This kindle is a good size, the battery life is great and the screen/backlights are nice but,  and this is a BIG but... it is really slow and is constantly locking up.  The screen will not respond, can't turn pages or even hit the shut off button when re booting, so have to hold the physical button on the bottom forever.  I've had this for about 3 months and read probably 40 books or so.  I have to re boot just about every day (a VERY slow process).  When waking up it takes forever before you can swipe to unlock.  Sometimes if I shift my fingers on the bezel edges (not the screen itself) the pages just start flipping, if I try to go back (touch left side of screen) it flips forward.  I really dislike this newest kindle, it's a piece of junk and reading is now a chore (and I very much LOVE to read!!!!!)

    I have had kindle paper whites for years. I recently upgraded from the last model to this 2021 model and I regret it. The screen locks up frequently. This is my 2nd one as they replaced the first one after 2 days because it was locking up but the new one is even worse.  It locks up while on wifi and while in airplane mode so it is not a Wifi issue. I‚Äôve done hard restarts and also reset it. Nothing helps. When it finally does correct itself, the touchscreen will be very slow/delayed until I let is sleep for hours. It‚Äôs new so I have 5.5GB free so it should not be related to storage.  I also have the most current update. Customer service just has me reset it which had not solved the problem.

    Newspaper download requires reset every single day
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my 10th Kindle. I love Kindle Paperwhite. BUT, and this is a huge BUT, Amazon‚Äôs latest software upgrades have completely destroyed the newspaper subscription download function. So, if you love reading The New York Times and Washington Post daily on your Kindle Paperwhite, you will be driven mad. Hours of time wasted with tech support trying in vain to fix this, only to be informed, finally, that there is no fix and the automatic daily download of my newspapers is a problem Amazon is working on. So, I have to completely reset my Kindle every single day if I want to read today‚Äôs newspaper. This involves inputting my Internet password, Amazon password, choosing my language and country, waiting for the device to reset, declining Kindle Unlimited, and many more steps. Supremely irritating if you want to read the newspaper with your morning coffee. And this problem has been going on for months. This is an example of how Amazon‚Äôs software ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù have ruined a great feature of the Kindle Paperwhite. Every morning as I spend five minutes resetting in a ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù type of rage, I hope some Amazon software engineer has been fired.

    First Kindle, malfunctioned in 2 weeks and had to get a replacement.
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I received this Kindle Paperwhite for my birthday on December 26th, 2021. This was my first Kindle. 10 days later, the screen froze out of nowhere on the Kindle logo and it would not unlock or turn off. I tried to follow all the steps on the customer service help page to restart the Kindle, but the screen would not even turn off.Customer service offered to replace my Kindle right away (I'm currently waiting on the replacement). However, I had to make the trip to UPS and pay for packaging myself. They will not send the new one until they receive the old one. My replacement Kindle has not updated any shipping or delivery information other than ""order received""I've read customer reviews similar to my situation that have expressed that their replacement Kindle did the exact same thing that their originals did OR they were given a refurbished Kindle when it should've been brand new. I'm hoping to loop back to this with some positives once my replacement comes.

    Got it yesterday, updated it.  Now there are ads on the homescreen, and it's frozen at least twice.  Had to hold the button down to crash it.  It's also down to 44% battery life after about 4 hours of reading.  Not very impressive.FYI I bought the version without ads.UPDATE 2021.11.14 - The power drains have stopped.  It's still frozen several more times, that you can't go to the next page.  Have to reboot it to get it to work.

    Had I known that I was getting into a product that seems like a 4th or 5th grader programmed at their whim with no Planning involved I would NOT have bought this Kindle. I'm used to computers in general and between my Mac and Win machines I would choose my Mac 1,000 times out of 1,000 over the Win, however, I live in a ""Windows"" world atmosphere and use it more. This Kindle is positively wonk-oh as far as trying to even find your files and then when you do, nothing that you've pulled down from Am to your computer seems to be ""findable"" quickly. I had to hunt all over for those Downloads because they didn't go to my Downloads FOLDER! Amazon KINDLE needs to hire about 10 APPLE Programmers to make the Kindle even somewhat 'human friendly"". NOT a happy customer especially with all of the marketing hype about how easy it is to sit and read your books. I have one on-screen that continually pops up which is frustrating to the MAX. There is no way to END the damned thing!

    While the screen is larger, the margins are smaller, this constantly triggers settings screens or page backward, etc., all commands on the margins of the screen.Also, the lack of of direct connectivity to seamlessly download new books or synchronize the device means you have to be looking for wifi when you travel.It was more expensive than my previous kindle & it was a downgrade. I am seriously considering not buying a kindle next, just sticking with the kindle app next time.

    I am very disappointed in the new Kindle. The home screen was very cluttered with way more than the books that I loaded - all sorts of ""recommendations, etc"".I was also disappointed at how difficult it is to download a book by USB. In addition it requires wi-fi to open a book for the first time, which makes it quite to do so when I am not home.To try to reduce the unwanted icons, I bought the ""no ads"". This didn't get rid of all the flotsam and jetsam, and on top of that the fee is not refundable. Can we say ""RIP OFF??""It seems that the Kindle creators are trying to make this do everything.  All I want is a simple e-reader that I can load up with books to read any where and any time. This doesn't come close to what I am looking for, so I am returning it!

    This is my 6th or so kindle, so I know these devices well. The hardware is nice.I'm writing to talk about the Kindle software, which is constantly pushing me to buy more stuff and I'm sick of it. It's trying to get you to sign up for Kindle Unlimited, GoodReads, and Audible.You no longer have the option of defaulting to the Library screen, and it always goes to the Home screen, which is just trying to recommend you more books.On the library screen, the list view is comically huge to the point where you can only see 5 books/files per page. They don't want you to browse your own books/files. You can't change the size, it's so irritating.If you choose the ad supported option, you now have to swipe every time you wake the device to get rid of the ads. The ads use to be on the sleep screen only, now they are in your face when you wake the device.It makes me want to leave the ecosystem.

Downloading new books is frequently a nightmare; usually get a message that an error occurred. This is my 3rd Kindle Paperwhite and absolutely the worst ever. Oh, and I've only had it for 2 months.

    I bought the new version of the Paperwhite in November.  I have owned three different kindle versions (my husband and kids also have Fires) and I have used one for many years every single day.  I was excited about finally seeing that there was an updated version.  There are some things that I liked about the updated device, like the quicker turning pages, but I didn't notice much of a difference between the older size and the newer, larger size.  I was not a fan of the new library set up, but overall, it was a fine device.  However, after less than 6 months, it went into a cycle where you couldn't turn it on-it would boot up like it was turning on, but then would turn immediately back off.  It does this every 40 seconds...and has for the past few days.  It charges, but is stuck in an initialization cycle.  I spent 20 minutes on a chat with Amazon help today and they will refund my money (after I send it back), but now I don't know whether to order another one or not.  There seems to be a lot of issues with this newer version and I don't love the idea of buying it again only to have another one break.

Library is hard to access from a book.  charging cord plug-in is at the bottom instead of the top which makes it difficult to have it sit on a stand for hands-free reading.  Changing whether you read landscape or portrait is also tricky.  Why can't it just change when you. change the orientation of the screen?  Not worth the money spent.

    I decided to buy this for Christmas as an upgrade over a Kindle Fire that is probably 7+ years old. I don‚Äôt remember when it was purchased. I received the Paperwhite and immediately started learning how it worked. I have lots of cons which is why I returned the Paperwhite and went back to my Kindle Fire.Display: Kindle Fire has a color display, Paperwhite does not. I thought I‚Äôd be okay with this and I wasn‚Äôt. I like seeing book covers and text in color. Although the Paperwhite does have a lot more options for font size and style, screen brightness.Interface: Kindle Fire has all of your buttons for home, back, text, notes at the bottom of the screen. I like this setup. Paperwhite you had to tap the screen and have all of the buttons pop up. Some were at the top, some at the bottom. A lot of times when I would tap the screen the page would turn. It was very frustrating and probably the biggest dislike I had with the Paperwhite. Home Screen on the Paperwhite is also very confusing and not user friendly.Battery: Depending on how much I use my Kindle Fire the battery usually lasts about 12 reading hours. I used the Paperwhite for 24 hour reading hours and the battery hardly went down at all.Processing: I thought the Paperwhite would be fast in its processing speed but it wasn‚Äôt any faster than my Kindle Fire.Overall: overall I didn‚Äôt feel like the Paperwhite was an upgrade over my Kindle Fire.

    My new Kindle is so finicky I can barely use it--and therefore I hate it. Many many many times it won't even turn the page when I touch the screen, and then at other times it bumps me ahead 20 or more pages when I touch the screen, and then I can't go back and find my spot again--because who is ever going to remember location??? This happens over and over again. All the changes they made to the way you get around on the Kindle is extremely confusing, invisible, and hard to use, and is not straightforward like it used to be, and all of that, i.e., moving around, too, is extremely finicky, so that when you finally DO figure out how to get where you want to go, nothing works. They've taken away the ""list"" for your library, and put pictures there instead, which is extremely cumbersome and makes it hard to use/look/glance at your library, to figure out what you've read and what you want to read next, even if you can even manage to get to your library in the first place. I wish I could return it, but I'm past my return date.

    Dead Pixels, Amazon Refuses to Replace Device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    So I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite on sale. And unfortunately It's beginning to look like it's going to be fully returned. I've had it for less than 24 hours now and it already has at least 1 possibly 2 dead pixels, that are franky driving me nuts, call me neurotic or a perfectionist but when you shell out 100+ dollars for an electronic device you kinda expect it to be working for the company that manufactures and sells them to be able to offer a replacement of the device.I've gone around in a circle with customer support for a half hour now trying to get it sorted out but its becoming quite clear they don't care about honoring the standard retail arrangement of exchanging defective items. Kinda disappointing because I enjoyed reading it on it I guess. But I'm not going to pay 100+ dollars and then play 130+ dollars because customer support ""can't give a replacement""Update: After an hour online with customer service I finally got someone who knew what they were doing well enough to actually help me out.  I will update the review once a replacement has been received and hopefully has a fully functional screen.Update 2: It's been a couple of weeks now (almost a full month) still no eta on the replacement. Though they did appear to put the order through. Just waiting for an actual update to that ETA date still. Definitely would not recommend purchasing a Kindle at this point. I don't think that opinion will change. It's not worth the money for the hassle.

Touchscreen recognition is awful so pages don‚Äôt turn and highlighting precisely is a chore.When I‚Äôm dark mode, it turns white when you turn the page so defeats the purpose of dark mode.I‚Äôve owned an older paperwhite, an oasis, and the first kindle touch. This is definitely the most disappointing and there‚Äôs been no major changes. Year after year it‚Äôs basically the same device coming out but with more software bugs than the previous models. I‚Äôm definitely going to wait for a huge improvement before I buy another kindle.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The thin bezel is supposed to be an improvement but I cant hold the Kindle without a page turning or a menu popping up. All I want to do is hold it without having to glue on some kind of holder which defeats my purposed of having a thin, light weight kindle.I have a very old Kindle that I love but will no longer be able to download books as of the end of December. I never thought that I'd lose all my books and collections with an upgrade but books do not transfer and collections have to be recreated...after you download the book again! I'm sure it is the same with the 2018 model but at least I can comfortably read a book once I have downloaded it again and put it a collection again.I love the color adjustment and the battery life but I'm getting a 2018 version that at least has barely enough room to hold the device.

    This is the 4th Kindle I've purchased.  This product is just worse in every way.  My first Kindle was fast, quick, and snappy.  Easily the best purpose built device I had ever bought.Flash forward 5 years and today's Kindles are a joke.  The device is very slow and takes a long time to wake up or navigate the store.  Even turning the page results in a slight but noticeable delayThe brightness setting is pointless.  Regardless of where you set it, it will default to max brightness when you open it up for the first time, before reducing to your requested brightness a few seconds later.  This is a huge annoyance as I read at night.The reworked UI doesn't add any features while making you click 2-3 more times to adjust common settings like 'Brightness' or 'Font size'.I would not recommend an Amazon Kindle at this point.  They might have been good devices 5 years ago, but they've taken a step back since then and Amazon doesn't seem interested in righting the ship.UPDATE: After writing this review, Amazon called me in the middle of the week day to ask how they could fix it.  I asked the caller if he read my review.  He admitted that he had not.  Not only does Amazon make a bad product, they annoy you when you tell them about it.

    Update. Amazon has reached out for details about my issue. An exchange has been received. So far, it has made it through the update process. I am cautiously optimistic.Used for a couple of weeks. Paperwhite was a better reader than my previous fires. Loved the small size. No glare screen was beyond awesome.Touch screen was not sensitive enough to my liking but I was adjusting.Then it died. It's like in the middle of an update that it can't complete. I asked for an exchange and two weeks later, 3 chats and 2 calls to customer service, nothing. I'm finally asking for a refund. I thought that customer service would have been better for an actual Amazon product.Product good, turned bad and customer service made it worse. TBC.

    The AD version of this device is awful
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This is my third Kindle, and I've got to say it's the most disappointing. I had the 3rd and 7th general of Paperwhite, and only until their last days of operation did they begin to perform badly. This thing, on day one, let me swipe the unlock screen once before deciding that I needed to spend 45 minutes trying to get to the books I pre-paid to read on a device I paid good money for, to boot. Is the point of the 11th generation of this device to actually spend all of my time buying books but not reading them? Good grief. I would have purchased a non-Ad version for more, except that delivery would have been weeks instead of days, and my 7th Gen just up and died. Incredibly disappointing. Extremely aggravating. Now I wonder how much will it be to ""buy"" off the ads and get back to reading.

This can‚Äôt be true. If it is, can they have another update to fix it. As of this moment, you can only permanently delete a book which means if you bought it then you would have to buy it again.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    On my first device, the screen is greenish/darker around the bottom left edge, and I cant stop noticing it every time I read near that location.On my second device, it was a yellow blotch appearing slightly above the bottom left corner, with a diameter about 1/5 of screen width. Again, my eyes are attracted to it every time I read to that location.Both issues would appear under low ambient light, and disappear if ambient/day light is strong, so it seems that it's a front light issue. If I turn warm light all the way to max, I won't notice them, but the screen would be just too yellow.A Kobo libra 2 is on the way, if it has an even screen I'll keep it, otherwise I'll just return all three. I really like the paperwhite to work because it fits my budget better, but I am disappointed at this point.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had an older Kindle that I loved. In order to sell more products, Amazon changed the requirements on what version of Kindle could handle the new downloads and purchases. My old one had an easy feel in your hands, and the little side page-turner button was in the perfect location so you didn't have to keep letting go of the Kindle and moving your hand. This one has a very sensitive touchscreen. You have to let go of one side of the device and tap the screen every time you want to turn the page.You may tap it and while you lift your finger you may brush against it again and then you've advanced more pages than you intended and you've lost your place.  And if you're exploring the store, be careful that you don't buy something you don't want because the screen is so sensitive you very well might do that. Then it's a whole ordeal to un-buy it. New and improved it is not!

There is a sleep button on the bottom that constantly turns the device off while you‚Äôre reading.  Maybe the top would have been a better place to put it.

Again, went through all the trouble-shooting steps, with no change. This time the CS rep said ""they all do that.""  The next call, to a manager, resulted in the same comment. Brick wall. If this is true, then this is a terrible product if you like to read.  Interestingly, one of the video reviews shows a woman turning pages with absolutely no black flashing.

    So, the Kindle has been working fairly well since I've got it a couple of months ago but sadly, I had to wait over a month for the adapter to arrive just to charge it. The adapter arrives and I'm thinking, ""Cool, now I can charge it,  keep reading and I'm all set""...Wrong. The cord that they sent literally with the Kindle won't fit the charging slot on the device itself so basically, I waited over a month and spent close to $200 for a device that I can't charge because they gave me a cord with it that doesn't fit

    Terrible Quality Control
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Received 4 of these generation 11 Paperwhite Kindles. All of them had defective screens: Pixels which appear white on dark text or backgrounds, and pinholes that appear dark on white backgrounds. The pinhole type is even visible after turning the screen off (so there is no image and 0% brightness). With the screen off, it looks like a shiny dot. My previous gen Kindles did not have these problems.Surprising how well reviewed this device is considering the defects and poor quality control I encountered 4/4 times.Returning all 4- I don't even care about the Prime Day deal anymore, not worth the price for this junk.

Contacted customer service for a replacement and was told that no replacement was available and only offered a refund. But I purchased the item on sale and it is now full price.  They said there was nothing they could do.  Seems strange, very disappointed.  Will wait until it goes on sale again and try to buy a replacement then.  When it worked it was nice, though battery life was a bit worse than expected.

    Garbage compared to previous Kindle Paperwhites
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had a Paperwhite purchased years ago but it was getting older, and the battery wasn't lasting as long. I should have just had the battery replaced, but knew Kindle was coming out with a new generation. I donated my old Kindle, and received this version, 11 Generation, no ads, for Christmas in Dec 2021. Right away I disliked the protruding power button on the bottom that was super sensitive and would power off/on when propping the Kindle up to read or if packed in my handbag. Within a month it was glitchy. I knew getting a new one would be a nightmare--plus I am always in the middle of a good book!--so I just would reboot it. So many times I lost my place. Today, it went into a continual loop of re-booting and shutting off. I am beyond disappointed. They should stop selling this faulty product.

    I'm not impressed with this Kindle version.  Have a terrible time locating books I've downloaded from the Kindle Unlimited store.  It turns out that if you download more than one book in a series, the Kindle creates a collection.  If I want a collection, I'll create it myself.  My old Kindle put all the new downloads together so they were easy to locate.  The only reason I bought a new kindle is because my ancient Kindle died.  I do like that fact that this Kindle is easier to read.

    My complaints lie with the navigation which is almost entirely random. Getting back to the Home page was damn near impossible. There is a Home button on the bottom of the page (instead of the top?) which simply does not work. In fact nothing at the bottom works.The entire navigation metaphor needs an overhaul by a team that actually understands the user experience..Since I am visually impaired, I purchased an audio bock as my first text. It lists 19 unnamed chapters. No matter which chapter I click on, it takes me to somewhere else. WFT? There is absolutely no correlation between the chapters listed in Kindle and the chapters in the book.I called their customer service and told them to send me a replacement. I hope I just got a bad unit. If not, I am stuck.

    I love to read. I had an original Paperwhite I bought almost 10 years ago that I lost in a move. I bought this one and had it for two months. I just asked to return it last night. Several times over the two months the thing would randomly freeze, while I was in the middle of reading, and begin updating itself, the process itself took at least 10 minutes and ended me on a nice white screen and an inability to navigate anywhere. I had to restart the thing manually.When I went online to remedy the process, there are two solutions: Jailbreak your paperwhite, or use airplane mode EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO READ.You aren't even allowed to turn off mandatory updates for a later date. Why did the engineers allow it to update without being connected to a charger? Or WHILE ACTIVELY IN USE?Anyway, after the xth time it's shut down and restart itself, I'm done. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

It wouldn‚Äôt restart and had to be returned within a month. Exchanged for a new one. New one locked up like the first in just a few weeks. This device is not stable yet and should not have been released to the public.Overall, the UI is clunky and confusing to use. Setting are all over the place. You just poke around until you find want you need. It‚Äôs easy to turn pages unintentionally because the narrow borders make it easy to get your finger on the screen. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to use without a case.Having said all that, the screen is so good that I would be willing to live with it if the device was reliable. Sending this second one back. Going to get an small iPad from a pawn shop to replace it. Pity...

    It's just too frustrating to figure out how to use it. If you accidentally touch something, the book might go to the last page, or the first page, or who knows where. Then it takes multiple attempts to get back to where I was. Do I tap? Do I swipe? Sometimes I'd accidentally touch the screen before I swiped and it does what it wants. Kindle Unlimited is limited. For some reason, I could only download maybe 10 books. I don't want to buy them. Most of the books I was interested in could only be purchased. If an author had a set of 5 books, I had to download one at a time, making me go back to the store to find the next one. It would be nice if the Home and Library buttons were always displayed.

However, while its screen is more responsive and broader, it used to freeze every time I tried to browse in the Kindle store or download new books. That was super annoying because I only had it for a few weeks and my old 7th generation Kindle works better than this one. Battery life is also very short, it doesn't last for weeks or a month as promised. In fact, it has a shorter lifespan than my old Kindle's battery had when it was new. And what's worst, this new Kindle became unresponsive after only three weeks of use, it got stuck during the restart and it's not working anymore. So, I don't recommend this item, if you don't want to lose your money for defective and slow device. I can't even get replacement item as I don't live in U.S.

    1. The Kindle I had before was better visually and did not have the issues of the new models.  First, the new ""gray-shading"" phase makes the book covers unreadable and less sharp.  Second, it drops the internet connection when I am literally 5 feet from it and surrounded with a laptop and iphone--all connected.  Third, the keyboard just disappeared.  I've called and gone through instructions to reset and  it will come back but it never has.  FOURTH: So now, I cannot connect to the internet because I cannot type in the password because I do not have a keyboard! Fifth. Maybe an Apple iPad is the way to go than the endless frustrations of needing to endlessly update or endlessly figure out why the new Kindle doesn't work.

I shook and shook it and water just keeps coming out through the USB port and power button.  Exchanged and the 2nd one did it too.  In fact if it‚Äôs underwater and you squeeze it slightly it sucks a lot of water into the device.  Even though it worked, that water will either cause corrosion or mold/mildew over time.

This is the first time I have been totally dissatisfied by Amazon ""customer service"".  Very disappointing.

    Years ago a friend gave me a Nook. I love my Nook. I can do email, use the Internet, read, and do all other kinds of stuff - in color! But my old nook is on its last legs. So, I decided in November to take advantage of the after Thanks Giving sales to get a Kindle. And after my Nook, it was quite a shock. I had a hard time getting used to it and went to eBay and bought another used Nook. Again, I love a Nook, but the battery life in this used Nook HD is truly terrible. Gradually I got used to the Kindle and used it more and more. One and a half months after purchase the Kindle quit with an error code. I returned the Kindle a week ago and I still have no date to when they will ship me a new one. Thank heavens for my Nook. So, as of now I am not a fan of the Kindle.

    A buggy device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My brand new Kindle Paperwhite is dead after three months and is on its way back to Amazon.  It shows a Code 2 Error and would not reboot.  Regardless of software or hardware issues, such a fatal flaw cannot be acceptable.Prior to this, I had encountered errors when I tried to delete book samples.  It just said it cannot be done and advised me to try later.  It also froze from time to time.There are other usability issues too.  The top bezel is too narrow so when I tried to hold it with my left hand‚Äôs index finger on it, it would open the drop down menu.  It is also too wide so I can not fit it to my hand comfortably.I don‚Äôt know how a buggy product like this could pass quality control.  I assume it will soon be replaced.

    Eight days after receiving my Paperwhite I had to return it.  A couple of days after receiving the Paperwhite my ""Uh-Oh"" sense was triggered when I the Paperwhite would not go to the next page unless I first went back to the prior page read.  Then the Paperwhite locked up for good on to the last page of a book I had previously read on my old Kindle.  Why there and not on some current page?Because my old Kindle is becoming obsolete, I'll need to buy another Paperwhite.  I can only hope my experience so far is not typical.

I also wanted to use bluetooth for my Airpods so I can listen to Audible books, but that does not work - the Paperwhite can connect to my Airpods but I hear no audio.

    I've owned a half a dozen or more different kindles and was very pleased with the purchase of this one until the newest ""update"" to 5.14.2. Removing the ability to view my books without your shitty thumbnails, breaking my ability to view collections, making it impossible to view more than 5 collections on a page since those also apparently need useless thumbnails (That are blank folder icons in this case since it's a collection so they're even more pointless). I've literally dug through my closet to find an old Kindle Oasis that I'll forcibly keep from updating should it try to do so. If I had the option I'd refund my purchase because as is, it's trash. Unless this is fixed you've lost a customer.

No.  The old version fit in a large coat pocket or a small purse - this version will be too big for both. One of the great things about the kindle is portability. Please make an updated version in the old size.  I had my first kindle for five years. I have had to buy a new one every 1.5-2 years for the past three.  Amazon only seems to be good at taking things that were fine and changing them for the worse.  I will probably end up with a ‚Äúnew‚Äù old version because mine does not hold charge, so i need one to charge at home and one to take take out with me.  New one is too big to carry around.

    Everyone recommends the Paperwhite. I do not. Its easy to read (when it actually opens a book) its a little slow to respond with a weird flickering between pages.

I wanted to restart the Kindle and the only button that worked was the cancel button so I cant even turn it off / restart it. This product is already a paperweight right out of the box.

Nope, even while not even touching the screen, the PAGES RANDOMLY TURN BACK & FORTH.  Also, after reading for maybe an hour, the PAGE FREEZES & I HAVE TO RESTART , which then loses my last page read.  Never had any problems with my original kindle & if this had happened, I would never recommend it.  Hoping to return this one & get a replacement.  We shall see.....

    On any other device when I select Dark Mode, to read in bed at night, I get a true white text on a black screen.Not so on this 2021 11th gen Paperwhite device. While the white is white, the black is also white. If you turn down the back light so it more dark, then the text is too dark also.If you turn up the back light so you can read the white text now the background lights up. In other words, the backlight is visible and lights up the screen. This is NOT what you want when reading in the dark.Save your money, get the plain Kindle, if you just want to read in the daylight.  I'll go back to my Kindle 3 keyboard model.BTW, this Kindle has a USB C connector. It's the only device I have that has it. So ANOTHER cable to carry. Another reason to return it.

    I used this product for pleasure reading.  The touch screen was very unreliable.  I would get stuck on a place in the book and couldn't get the screen to move.  I can no longer find the books in the library.  Sometimes the screen was very sensitive to the touch and would whisk me away far away.  I would like to return this Kindle and the new charger that I was forced to buy in order to use it. The older models were far superior to the current ones.

    When I first received this Kindle, I was in love. I had an older generation and used it daily. So I was excited for an upgrade. But a little less than a year, it broke. The screen just kept trying to load. Got sent a replacement and the screen stops working again. I am very cautious with my kindle. To have screen issues a 2nd time from a 2nd device is ridiculous. I never had any issues with my older one and I had that for over 3 years. So disappointing

    I have been a user of Kindles for several years now. I gave my spouse my previous Paperwhite and ordered a new one for myself in November. Yes, I'm a selfish bugger. Anyway, there were problems from the start. Initially the Kindle would not always save to the point read in books, even books from my Kindle Unlimited account.  I wasn't too worried as I believed the next update would probably solve the issue.  Yesterday it froze and all the Amazon troubleshooting tips failed to get it beyond the  boy-under-tree screen.  Called support and my only option was a refund.  I was hoping for an exchange as a matter of convenience.  Now I am wondering whether I should buy the current generation, or should just get the previous one which has never given me problems?

    It's been years since I owned a Paperwhite, so I was expecting great things from this new version.Why is the button on the bottom of the device? This is my biggest complaint. I've had the device for maybe 10 minutes and it's accidentally gone on twice now. Who designed that and thought it would be a good idea? I don't want one of those hard cases, so I can foresee this thing being on without me knowing.My other issue is the charger. It's my own fault for not realizing I'd have to buy a twenty dollar wall charger because I use a Chromebook, with no USB port. Ugh. So I'm returning it. No sense in being annoyed for this price.

    Doesn‚Äôt keep place in books
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I would advise sticking with your old kindle. This new one wasn‚Äôt keeping my place in my book. Every time I went to read again it would be in the wrong place way further back in my book. So I tried to restart it to see if that would help and it completely froze and will not come back on. I‚Äôve used kindles for 10 years and never had trouble like this with older models. So I‚Äôm returning this and going back to old reliable.

    I‚Äôve had 5 previous Kindles. All worked out of the box. Have loved them till they simply stopped. Solution ‚Ä¶ buy another. Support leaves a bit to be desired. Easier to just replace. The new one will not connect. Tried and true connection with multiple devices working on a daily basis. Patiently, went through the troubleshooting. Nothing. It‚Äôs headed to the trash.

    It fails at the basic function of the device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I spent about 40 minutes on chat with Amazon before the representative ""got disconnected"" then another 20 minutes or so on the phone with a representative -- None of them seem to know how to remove the requirement to swipe up to view my book. My 2015 Kindle just shows my book when I open the cover. Apparently that isn't an option anymore. So, this device will be going back. I'm not spending $200 to be forced to look at Ads.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This was my first paperwhite. Needless to say, I was pretty darn excited. Imagine my let down with every lag, screen freeze and long loading times. Pictures are also fuzzy when scrolling. If you want to use your Overdrive/Libby from your local library, forget about it! No app usage and the web browser is pretty much non usable with its constant loading and freezing. Who has time to get on the computer to send to the books you want from Overdrive to your Kindle. I sent this garbage back.

    I loved this until it stopped working less than 2 weeks after I got it. I am extremely disappointed. Amazon customer service says there is nothing they can do but replace it and it will take over a week and a half to ship the new one. Other reviews I have found online state a similar problem. You would think a device that has been in the making with so many generations and costs over $130 would be better quality.

    Update***  After speaking with Amazon about their Kindle Software Updates I am not satisfied with my Kindle Paperwhite.  They took my concerns and problems and said they would give it to the software developers and make it easier and more user friendly.  I am glad that they wanted to contact me about my concerns especially since my mother reads with the Paperwhite also.I love love love my Kindle Paperwhite but I hate this latest update!!!! I understand that it is to fix the latest bugs and issues but I do not like the new format for  Home and Library screen. I like being able to catalog my books by authors in collections but instead of searching for the collection I have to go through a bunch of crap and it will not let me save the books like before.My 81 year old mother who loves her Paperwhite is also fed up with the changes.  I would love to be able to download the bugs and fixes but not change the how my Home and Library screens look.I am seriously considering going with another Ereader from B&N or Apple Books because this is not a good direction for Amazon to be going especially a long standing Prime Member who has had an Ereader since 2011

I'll never understand how they get a screen to look like the page of a book, but I guess I don't need to understand it. All I know is that the Paperwhite makes e-books incredibly easy to read in any light setting, and I don't know why I've been reading paper books the last few years when I could have been reading them on a Paperwhite.

    Great Device, But Needs a Pocket Sized Model
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've been using my Kindle Paperwhite for about a year now. It's a fantastic device. The only caveat I have with the device itself is the size. If I stuck this device in my jeans, I'm barely fitting anything else and my pocket looks like a giant square. I would love it if Amazon released a kindle e-ink model that was the size of an iPhone. Something small enough to fit into a pocket. I would love to be able to slide my eReader into my jeans pocket next to my iPhone and be able to take it out on the go whenever I want. A simple eink device for much easier on the go experiences.Don't get me wrong, the current device size is great. But it's too big for the on-the-go individual. A smaller, pocket sized eink kindle would be convenient and more fun to use.Thanks!

    pros: great size, light in weight, good battery life, screen easy to read, stores books for easy accesscon: unexplainable to me I occasionally do something when I‚Äôm reading and the kindle goes from where I‚Äôm reading to the end of the book and have a nearly impossible time returning to the place I started from.  I‚Äôve tried bookmarking pages so I can more easily find a spot I‚Äôve read but then I have difficulty accessing my bookmarks. The kindle needs navigation tools to more easily know where your at in the book and more easily refer back to previous read sections of the book.

    Great upgrade from the standard Kindle!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love my new Kindle Paperwhite!Not long ago, I left my Kindle at home on a business trip. I struggled with the decision to upgrade and send the Paperwhite to my hotel, or to have my existing standard Kindle overnighted to me. Ultimately I had my existing Kindle shipped.I have come to regret that decision. I upgraded not long after that and the experience of the Paperwhite is well worth the extra cost. If you're stuck in a similarly priced conundrum: if you are deciding between the cheaper standard Kindle (or the cost to overnight one!) and the Paperwhite, the cost difference is marginal while the upgrades are palpable.There are many reviews of the Kindle Paperwhite from a new Kindle owner perspective. This review focuses on those who are considering upgrading from a standard Kindle to the Paperwhite and for those who are trying to choose between the two devices.It's easy to rationalize each and every feature of the Paperwhite as unnecessary. Technically, that is true. There is nothing the Paperwhite does compared to the standard Kindle that can be considered essential.But let's face it: Kindle's in general are not essential... they're just really nice to have.You might be wondering, for example, why you would want to read for an hour under 2 meters of water, save for preventing some accidental damage if you're reading in the bath. This, however, is an important and understated design feature. Though the IPX8 rating doesn't test for solid ingress, it would be hard to design a device to prevent liquid ingress and not prevent access of dust and debris.It is a strange decision to not test for a solid ingress rating, such as IP68. Amazon is burying the lead on this... the Kindle Paper White doesn't allow solid objects to get caught in the bezel. My former, standard, Kindle does. When a small particle of dust or pet hair gets caught in the bezel of my former Kindle, the screen does not register page swipes reliably. The bezel area in that Kindle is very thin and difficult to clean, which makes this issue difficult to resolve.The Kindle Paper White has no access to the bezel, the entire front is uniform. This is a major improvement in design and, in and of itself, represents a worthy reason to upgrade. This is the primary reason I wanted to move up to the Paper White. You can see in the photos the gap between the standard Kindle's bezel and screen that causes me some issues. If you plan on reading in the hot tub, there‚Äôs no comparison to be made between these two Kindles. I haven‚Äôt done so, but I imagine dropping the standard Kindle in the pool would result in far worse, irreversible damage than some dust on the screen, while the Paperwhite would suffer no damage at all.The other benefits to the Paper White were surprisingly nice, especially given that I hadn't initially considered them to be poignant at all. My favorite unexpectedly useful feature is the automatically adjustable variable light temperature setting. While it is nice to be able to make the Kindle's light warmer or cooler, it is much more practical to have this transition happen on a schedule. This way you can have a bright white light during the day, and have the backlight automatically turn to a soft warm light when reading at night. This prevents eye strain if you read to sleep and it an excellent feature.Other features that have improved on the Paperwhite:The fonts on the Paperwhite are smoother. The larger screen allows for more words on a page or a larger font size, allowing for a more pleasant experience. The page turns occur about twice as quickly on my new Paperwhite vs my former Kindle. The UI elements, for example accessing the menus or the Kindle store, are much more responsive on the Paperwhite.It would be harder to justify the price increase of the Oasis, as there don't seem to be any compelling advantages to that model over this one. The Paperwhite strikes an excellent value of features compared to pricing. Just be careful to get the most recent version, as some of the bundles contain older versions of this device.

    I enjoy using my kindle.  It‚Äôs small, light, and I can carry a whole room full of books in one small device.  The battery life is awesome.  Although the apps are pretty good, the paper white feature saves my eyes and I can read at the beach, in the sunshine, or even in the dark.  The only complaint is that there‚Äôs no good way to search your library without an internet connection. (Have I missed something?)  I‚Äôve had a kindle since they were first introduced and wouldn‚Äôt be without one.  I use my kindle when I‚Äôm out and away from internet - like camping or traveling.  Why can‚Äôt I just search for books on my device?  I gave it a 5 in spite of this drawback, simply because you do keep improving it and like I said, it‚Äôs my must pack for traveling.

    Software ruins hardware
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had Kindles for twelve years and the devices are good at what they do. The latest software update, however, is so bad that it genuinely makes me want to find a different ereader. Forcing an eink device to try and work like a tablet--taking away the simple lists of titles in favor of displaying book covers, making it impossible to quickly see what I'm looking for since now the screen can only show 5 books at a time--it's awful. I have hundreds of books, and the new design makes finding older ones impossible unless I can remember titles and authors to search directly. I have to assume this update was thought up by people who don't actually read much.

    I absolutely hate the newest update on Kindle software. I had to restart my kindle and it updated to an extremely unfriendly user format. If I put it in list format then books are interspersed with collections. If in collection view it‚Äôs a grid with junks up the screen with book covers and I can‚Äôt find anything. Plus series disappeared. I can‚Äôt figure it out. I was looked fir a book in a series, knew series name but not the book‚Äôs. After 20 minutes looking I had to go to Kindle store to find it. Although I gave almost 3,000 books I‚Äôm tempted to go to a different reader n my manufacturer.There should be a way to have any view be set as a grid or list view. I loved having a collection view followed by series and those books not in collections. Now in collection view they put ever No in a collection in a collection of Kindles making and I can‚Äôt find anything in it.I‚Äôve owned Kindles since the very first one was released. This is the worst update in all these years.

    Kobo Libra 2 vs Kindle Paperwhite (2021)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This review is for anyone who is debating between the new kindle Paperwhite and the Libra 2.If you are like me, you do extensive online research, obsess over reddit forums, YouTube reviews, etc... before making a decision on any electronic device that you buy. I probably watched every single YouTube review of Libra 2 and Paperwhite, and most reviewers said that both were basically equivalent.Well, I went ahead and bought both to try them, and here is what I liked/didnt like between the two:Observations:* Paperwhite is significantly lighter weight than the Libra 2. Although it is lighter, it is a lot harder/straining to hold than the Libra 2. Because the size bezels are thin, it is really un-ergonomic hold with your thumb right on the edge. Or you can hold it from the bottom, but that becomes awkward after about 30-45mins too. The Libra 2 however, is heavier, but has a, IMO, much more ergonomic grip and has space to put your thumb. This allows your other fingers to grip the device from the back much easier.* The way Libra 2 formats the text on the screen is better than Paperwhite. It also allows for a few more customizations which, for me, make huge differences. Libra 2 allows you to put the position of where you are in the chapter and the chapter name at the top of the screen. It also allows you to display your position in the entire book at the bottom of the device. For kindle, it just has a couple options of showing how much time you have left in the chapter, and how much time of reading is left in the book at the very bottom left. You don't know how many times I accidentally tap on the screen and lose where am in the book. With kindle, I have no idea what page I am on when I accidentally tap on the page. On the Libra 2, I see the page numbers and its super easy to re-orient myself.* Everyone says the screen quality between the kindle and libra are equivalent. I one million percent disagree. Libra 2 display is WAY more crisp and clear. The dark mode on Libra 2 is leagues better than paperwhite. When you look at them side by side, it is obvious that the Libra 2 screen is better. My wife also looked at both and instantly noticed how much better the Libra 2 screen is. It is seriously unbelievable how crisp it is.* The whole ADS on the Kindle leaves such a sour taste in my mouth. I hate the fact that the Kindle shows ads and you have to pay to remove them. And even when you remove them, their homepage still has all the kindle store recommendations shoved up your face. Libra's interface is so much lighter. It just displays your books and that's basically it. I like that.* People say that both devices are equally responsive. I disagree. There isn't a HUGE difference, but there is a noticeable difference in Libra 2 being faster than Kindle. When I want to go back into the Home Screen (exit out of a book) the Libra 2 does it within 1 second. Kindle takes 2+ seconds to go back to the home page. I also notice Kindle does a lot more flashing and redrawing than Libra. I don't know if I can scientifically prove that though, its just my observation, so take that with a grain of salt.* Libra 2 has reading statistics for you. Its a really minor thing, but I really like it. I like to see how long I've read, how fast I read, etc, and Libra has a nice interface to see that. It is kind of like the Apple Watch fitness tracking, where you can go into the app and see all the workouts you have done. Its not required, but its nice to see your progress and makes you motivated to keep going.* I really like the Kindle's dictionary and flashcards feature. Anytime you look up a word on Kindle, it automatically saves it and you can go to all the words you've looked up and run them in a flashcards word define game. On the Libra, you can also save words for the dictionary, but there is no flashcard game.* I haven't really used the Kobo app, but the kindle app I think is really amazing. The syncing between the Kindle app and the kindle device is great. I don't know if the kobo device have that, but I think Kindle just wins on this front. I don't read on my phone, so its not a huge deal for me.* Kindle uses a proprietary format it uses for the books. Libra does not-- it just uses the `epub` format.You can use what you find most important and purchase that. Both devices are really good at what they do, but I personally find the Libra 2 a much more bang for your buck, and an overall better device for me.I hope you find this useful!

    The new software STINKS
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    As others have said, the new software STINKS.On my old Kindle 2, I could see TEN books listed on the screen.On my PW after the update, I only see FOUR books !!!!!  Geez talk about going backwards.For a collection with 200 books, this goes from 10 pages on the Kindle-2 to 50 pages on the PW !!!!The only thing that makes this workable is the addition of a scroll bar.  With the scroll bar, I can use the bar to move through the MANY pages of books, rather than page through them one page at a time.  Even so, using the scroll bar is difficult in LARGER collections with more than 100 books.This is like Windows vs. DOS.Yeah windows is easier to learn and looks friendly, but DOS was more efficient and faster.We need an option to select a higher book per screen list mode display.Secondly, the PW performance can be sluggish, to the point that the PW sometimes seems to have hung, and the only way to do anything is to do a hard restart of the PW.What solved this problem was to turn Airplane mode ON, thus turning WiFi OFF.  With WiFi OFF the PW performance is reasonable.So, it appears that the PW is ""calling home to Amazon a LOT,"" and using up a lot of the processing power of the PW, leaving little left for you.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Unfortunately, I am once again(3rd time) going to have to replace my kindle reader.  The charger ports seem to have a built in obsolescence.  I read--a LOT. Therefore I need to charge this a lot.  If all of our phones can be charged daily without the charging ports becoming worn out, the Amazon can produce a better product.  Replace the charging ports with better quality--or fix them for us when they wear out!!!

    A reasonable tool - until the last software update.
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Since the last software update (Spring 2022) my Kindle Paperwhite has been unbearably slow when switching between books or moving around my library. It's fine to read from once you're in a book, as long as you don't want to move around inside the book - that is slow too. (Also, the removal of the Back button in the upgrade before last makes it much more difficult, eg to skip ahead in a book or look up some plot point in an earlier book in the same series, then get back to where you were reading.)Capacity is good (I have well over a thousand books on my Kindle), screen resolution and readability are great, so this really is a case of a poorly-thought-out software ""upgrade"" greatly decreasing the usability of an otherwise excellent device. I was an early adopter and have owned a number of different Kindle models, so I can report that this slowdown is a new change.

    BUY AN OLD ONE
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had several Kindles. The older ones are best. The new software is terrible. You used to be able to buy a book & hit download. Now, it may or may not download. It may be just in the cloud. Then you have to fool around to find it & get it sent to your device. Also, the library pages stink. Keep scrolling down to find your books. You can't just flip pages quickly. Scrolling takes forever when you have 100's of books you're browsing. Lastly, it's SLOW. Before I could turn pages quickly while reading. Not anymore. It's a wait while the pages load. Kindle...go back to what you did well.

",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Two devices help organize my life - my iPhone and my 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite.  The former keeps me connected, too much so, and the latter allows me to disconnect except when I want targeted connection on a book - whenever and wherever.  I thought I would upgrade the Kindle after 8 years of excellent service, but it was not to be.  The 11th generation has a better screen and view, but the control over connection is gone.  You have to be tethered to WiFi, and you have to endure a home screen that connects you to ads posing as recommendations.  Sure, you can choose, for the time being, to have the device open on the library page and avoid the recommendations, but I suspect it won‚Äôt be long before that changes as well. Amazon, I don‚Äôt understand.  I am going to buy books from the store anyway.  Why annoy me like this?  And why make it harder to buy books by making me find a WiFi connection?  The beauty of my old device is that I can go from a sample to the full book anytime, anywhere by pressing a button.  That‚Äôs why I am keeping it and returning the upgrade.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Bought this at Best Buy, there was no mention on the price tag, in the advertising at the display kiosk, or at the sales counter that this was ""ad supported."" Maybe some users wouldn't find the ads annoying. I found them super annoying and assumed it was something I could turn off. Turns out I have to pay to turn off ads. So now after buying a device at what I was made to believe was it's full price, with no mention of any limitations, I have to pay an additional $20 to remove ads. Pretty disgusting way to sell a product, honestly. I'll never recommend this device to anyone for that reason. If it had just been mentioned upfront I would have had no problem at all just paying $20 more at the time of the sale.It works fine if you want to read stuff, the screen is pleasant, size is good, battery seems fine, but I'd recommend literally any other device on the market after that really gross sales experience.

Now, what shows up is a list with the slowest scrolling i have ever seen.  What happened to the easy-to-use and handy access we used to have??  If i don't remember the EXACT title of a book, i can't get to it by typing it in Search. So that means the tedious time-consuming scrolling.I am a senior citizen, and there may be a way to change it back, or a way to get to my books easily -- but I don't know how to do it.  And the present system is not user friendly enough to be able to figure it out.Please simplify access to paperwhite content!  -- and/or take it back to having our 3 most recent books easy to get to, and other books not hidden in a list which is so time consuming to navigate!

    I was happy with my paperwhite for almost two years. It is perfect for reading outside in direct sunlight. Battery life is amazing. Then one day it decides to flip pages, change font size, highlight text, add bookmarks, restart, and shut down. After restarting the whole process would start again. Imagine trying to read a book like this! I could then go for a few days with it being a normal reader, but soon enough I'd be back to Satan taking control. I called to talk to amazon chat who told me to do a factory reset. Did that then the touchscreen no longer worked. Now I am left with a paperwhite stuck on a lock screen that moves its cursor all around the screen on its own and no way for me to control it. But Allan at amazon offered me 15% off a NEW reader (not a used one) to go through this torment all over again. I have been a prime customer for a million years. I have 600 kindles. Do I need another one? I would gladly return all of them to amazon if they gave me ONE that worked.

I would definitely recommend reading on an iPad if you have one. I have never tried it on another type of tablet, but my guess it's probably better as well.

",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Imagine you have hundreds of documents in a folder on your computer and you want to scroll through them.  Now imagine the only way you can scroll through them is by viewing their document icons in a grid pattern, rather than just being able to read the file names from top to bottom.  Well, that's what you'll have to do if you buy the latest Kindle Paperwhite.If you've bothered to create Collections to organize your books, forget them.  They'll still be there, but you won't be able to view them in List format.  Instead, you'll be forced into a glacially slow scroll through grids of book covers from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, squinting to read the book titles amidst all the useless graphic nonsense.  It used to be that you could opt out of this obnoxious view and manually switch back to List view, but for some reason, Amazon has taken that option away.  What an amazingly bad decision in an age where Accessibility is a by-word.I can't fathom why they did this.  Do they think they're somehow going to turn my black-and-white Kindle into some kind of dazzling display of artistic wonder?  Do they think they're going to sell me more books by enticing me with pictures of books that I already own?Whatever.  Amazon appears to have embraced the ""we know better than you, and your preferences are meaningless"" attitude that is endemic in today's tech world.  If I were you, I wouldn't buy a Kindle until they've stopped trying to control your navigation preferences.  I mean, look at your bookshelves at home.  You have a system, right?  Whatever that system is, you know right where to go to find what you're in the mood to read, and all you have to do is go to that section and peruse the titles on the spines.  If someone came along and messed with your system...if they told you could no longer organize by genre and that you must place your books so the full cover displays instead of just the spines...what would you tell them?  I'm guessing it would involve at least one curse word.In summary, I'd recommend holding off on your purchase.  Wait until the Masters of the Universe have figured out that you, the customer, actually matter in this equation.  And I'd recommend not holding your breath.

I was offered the consolation price of a 20% discount on getting myself a new kindle.So basically, things are done so cheaply now that I am just supposed to throw away a device that should be able to be easily fixed.  What is it with this throw away culture??  How is it that the only advice to fix something is to restart?  That's what I used to do 20 years ago as a lab assistant in college, there has to be a smarter answer than restart or throw away.

I kept receiving error messages from Amazon that there was a problem with the document I was sending.I keep finding books I placed in collections listed as ""uncollected"" on my devices 4, 5, & 6, all the newer devices. I find books and docs sent to 2 devices when I sent to 1.Preorders and new purchases/free books through Amazon, I choose which device to send it, amazon has been sending to my default one instead and I have to go into my account each time and remove from one device and/or send to correct device.In addition, you can't just ""remove from device"" on the device, noooo, that doesn't work properly or isn't even an option anymore.Honestly, quit improving because all that's happening is alot of crap showing up on devices that cannot be changed.

The library page numbers have been removed; To remove a book from the kindle reader, you must now permanently delete the book, meaning to read it later you must pay for it again. Now the books you have already read are on your kindle along with your unread books. Sloppy programing making the kindle experience frustrating.

    Terrible battery life and keeps crashing!
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Ok, so I think I may be on one of those game shows, where I'm being ""played"" a fool or ""pranked"". LOL! (trying to keep a sense of humor with this). I posted a review about a day ago--which interestingly has since been deleted by an ""unknown"" person. In the review I cited issues with the battery life being terrible (12 hours at best), and the browser being like a play from a movie about technology in 1984. :-) Anyways, I got an email from Amazon asking if I'd like to chat with a representative to share more info. I replied, ""sure"". I spoke with an agent (not to be named, I am NOT in this to get someone into trouble--this is a company issues, not a client service tech issue).  I explained the issue with my paperwhite--it gets pretty minimal usage. The battery lasts for no MORE then 12 hours--when on a FULL charge and not being used. The client service rep and I had a good laugh, and agreed that I now have a $200 paper weight. LOL! Get the pun?? Hahahha! Anyways, sucks to be me, feel like a need a background song by the Fugees (killing me softly), to sooth my sad wounds. Maybe I should just have more wine at this point. So, after the call I get ANOTHER email from Amazon. Dare say I think I may have a chance at some form of client service ""caring"". I get a guy on the phone who is LITERALLY ""Varashunu"" from SouthPark. (see link below).  He says ""how can I help you"" and I repeat that THEY had called me. That my Kindle Paperwhite is a POS and won't hold a charge. He says how long do I keep it on? I say, it won't stay on for longer then 12 hours--when NOT even being used. He said that is 100% normal. I had that's complete BS--the advertisement shows 48 hours. This is NOT normal. He replies, (i think this is what he said) you are just ""s**t out of luck, lady"". And, then I hang up the phone.  I'm now laughing out loud, while drinking my delish new glass of chardonnay.  With a $200 paperwhite device being used as a paperweight.So, all is well--back to the same place I was. Sadly, Amazon does NOT stand behind their products. And, they are now staffing members of the SouthPark cast.

    The more they try and make a Kindle like a tablet the less reason I have to own a Kindle
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have to say over all, I love my Kindle, the first one I owned lasted me 8 years before I needed a new one and I use the new one pretty much every day. however over the last several updates it seems that Amazon wants to make my Kindle look and behave more like a tablet and less like a book. I mainly use my Kindle because it feels more like a book to me. but I guess Amazon feels they know what is best so I don't need a way to revert to a older look and feel. not to mention the so called Home screen they have crammed in that looks like my Amazon home page on my PC where they can ""recommend"" books each time I open my Kindle, and even though I have paid to not receive ads. Yes I know the actual ads are far worse and more intrusive. but if you are going to recommend a book, wait until I am shopping for one  and do not push it in my face every time I read.

    Good Performance, Poor Interface
  
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    First the good.  The anti-glare screen is quite good. Off angle viewing is not a problem and you can set the brightness to any reasonable level. The font changing is easy and THE biggest selling point IMO. For those of us with old eyes, using a big font makes a big difference. The battery life really IS impressive, even if you view with the brightness turned all the way up.  Now the bad. The interface needs completely overhauled. Something so simple as accessing your library is ridiculously difficult. AMAZON should take a page from the iPhone and have the equivalent of a ""home button"". It's actually easier to turn the device off and turn it back on than to navigate to your library. A larger Kindle has been the dream of just about everyone that has ever owned one but AMAZON refuses to consider this. I have no idea why. They'd make an ever bigger mountain of gold.

    Review of Update Spring 2022, not device
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The most recent update makes searching for previously purchased, downloaded content take much, much longer than it used to. This is extremely frustrating to longtime Kindle users.  This is due to several changes:1. Because of the pictures of the books, only 4 items can be displayed on the screen in a list at one time. So one has to get through more screens to even read through a list. It would be GREAT if there could be an option in ""Library View"" to not show the cover picture icons.2. Previously, in ""Library View"" collections were (or could be) listed together at the top of a list, with un-collected items below ordered based on recent usage. After the update, items are listed (again, just 4 at a time) as collections and both collected (in a collection) and uncollected items in, for example, ""recently used"" order. The very frustrating thing is that both the item and the collection that item is in are listed as separate items on the screen. This means that if the two most recent items read were from 2 different  collections, from the main ""Library"" screen, one sees just those items and the collections they belong to, because the display now only holds 4 items at at time.3. There is a scrolling arrow button on the side of the screen to help with scrolling, which is a much more frequent task now that one can only see 4 items in a list at a time. When going back to ""Library"" after reading something, the list is not reordered until one goes back to the top (keep tapping that arrow) of the list. It would be better, for the ""Library"" function, to get rid of the pictures and this arrow - allowing  only 2 lines for information about any item. Being able to view 8 items at a time (instead of just 4) would cut the need for scrolling in half.It seems that the update was created by a person or people who have not used Kindles very much.  The redesigned interface seems more appropriate for larger, brightly backlit, shiny color screens like iPads, not for much-easier-on-the-eyes-for-serious-readers e-readers. The re-designation of ""Home"" in the previous update as a marketing tool was not overly bothersome since what was previously ""Home"" got the new label of ""Library"" and worked basically the same way the former ""Home"" used to.  However, the most recent update has made even the ""Library"" view awkward and slow to use.Many long-time Kindle users have extensive libraries and keep hundreds of items on their Kindle e-readers all the time. This was the case even before the major memory upgrades that allow e-book fans to easily carry even MORE titles around with them. It is hoped that a new update will come out soon either restoring the previous ""Library"" view or at least allowing for simpler searching of large libraries.I love my Kindle, and I hope that the very serious problems with the most recent update will be fixed soon. I would be delighted to help whatever team is responsible for this improve the Kindle experience.

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have had this Kindle for less than a year, and it is already failing. When I open the store to browse for books, it repeatedly glitches and gives an error message. It will refuse to select certain categories, or refuse to scroll, or just go to error. I have restarted it many times, and did factory reset. The worst part is when I contacted support, they just told me to restart/reset, then I should just trade it in and get a new one! Talk about disposable junk attitude. They don't even expect it to last a year, or offer true support. Just throw it away and buy another if it glitches. ""Support"" seemed to know nothing, like how to help me check if it was updating.I really hate companies that design things to be landfill, forcing you to constantly replace. If they cared about quality, they would at least provide decent support.

    Great for reading, reading a zillion books, but  their interface is a huge waste of time
  
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    1) My now antique Paperwhite does nothing to automatically organize a book series into a author/book collection., it‚Äôs up to me.  Viewing a book collection online is no better. How come, the information is stored in a database?  2) Kindle makes me manually corral book series into a collection and once done are ordered by name order, not book order.  A huge time waster. Almost always, but not always Amazon list the book number but often that IS NOT visible when ordering a book and more often it IS NOT visible when you are deciding which book to read next on the Kindle making it necessary to read Amazon online descriptions, open the last read book to see their ‚Äúread next‚Äù message or open individual books to calculate what must be the first or next book in the series.  I just spent 4 hours organizing a collection instead of everything that is more enjoyable. Yes, I‚Äôm a little resentful and I still haven‚Äôt organized everything.  3) All books should  automatically show Author, book name, collection name, book number ordered by Author, collection name, book number. 4) Books in collections that have unread books (<99% read in a book) should show on the collection screen ‚ÄúNew‚Äù to indicate one or more books in the series is unread.  If your programmers have TiVo, tell them to emulate it. 4) When purchasing Kindle book, Amazon should provide the option to purchase the entire series followed by the ability to purchase each book listed by book order, not NAME order. 5) Stop lying to me, when I purchase a book or use the synchronize option give me the book.  I HATE, HATE being in an airplane and find that some of my books aren‚Äôt on the Kindle.  I always what my book immediately download and I always want everything synchronized but yet you still fool me. 6) When a new book in a series is released, put an icon on my book list indicating a new book can be purchased.  Allow me to navigate to my book series list, see the suggested book‚Äôs name and purchase the book by selecting the buy now icon.  Come on Amazon management, let the programmers do what they knew should have been don 5 years ago.

    Kindle users beware, some times Amazon updates your reader and does not test it.  This last update removed the back button from the menu so when reading a study bible if you hit a foot noted word it takes you to the scripture location as required so you can follow.  THE ISSUE: if you did NOT intend to select the footnote you CANNOT get back to your page unless you go back to the contents and start the chapter over.  Now that sucks because now instead of a smooth flow in reading you have to not only remember the chapter you are on but where you were in the chapter.  AMAZON: Do not update something that works well.  I have enjoyed the use of my kindle this is my second but now they need to fix the error and timely updates are not a priority for a conglomerate industry.  Jeff B should look into this if not his main tech CIO should or they will be getting back the kindles broken out of frustration.

    All good things must come to an end
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Within the next few months I will be upgrading to my 5th e-reader and my go to option was always the Paperwhite--until now. Late in 2021, Kindle came out with a new user interface. Unlike the previous version, the new design is not intuitive, it is cumbersome, and frankly, nothing more than a blatant marketing ploy to force readers into KU & one-click purchases.~For all of my previous Paperwhites, I had paid to remove the ads, but now it doesn't seem to make any difference because the home screen is now littered with ""suggested"" books for me to purchase.~Prior to the newer version, the home page always took you back to the first page of your library with your most recent read at the top. No more.~Although this was an inconvenience, the real sticking point for me was the removal of the back button. That was by far the best feature of the Paperwhite. Loved it. Gone.Suddenly, lo and behold, a couple of weeks ago, Kindle uploaded a bug fix.~In this version it now shows the thumbnail of each book cover in the library list. What a waste of resources! The text is not legible on the covers and the photos are grayscale-pixelated blobs.~The new layout only allows you to vertically scroll to review your library list. This serves two purposes, I suppose. First, it forces the reader to use both hands to operate the Kindle, because, ergonomically, you can no longer swipe the screen horizontally with your thumb to advance the page. Secondly, because the covers create a larger surface area, when scrolling the reader is constantly opening books by accident. This usually occurs once every one or two pages.~Finally, the most egregious offense is that the development team, once again, left behind back button. That is a deal breaker. If it would have been re-instituted with the latest update, all would have been forgiven and I would have continued to purchase Paperwhites.As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.

You can only see the first 4-5 books, so now have multiple pages to surf through.  Previous changes also make it harder to turn off wi fi to preserve battery life (adding more steps/touches) and making it more difficult to discern library rentals from owned books when deleting from device.

It won't respond to forced reboot.  It won't respond to anything.  After leaving it sit idle for four days, it appeared to heal itself.  I started reading the book where I'd left off.  Worked great for all of 15 minutes, then the print began to fade out and it wouldn't respond to touch controls again.  When it works, it's great.

I have over a thousand books on my paperwhite. I have most of them sorted into collections. I want them to BE in the collection. I do not want to see them outside of whatever collection *I* put them in. Currently it shows you either only some collections not even all of them, OR everything all jumbled up and in one huge list. I spent hour's sorting and organizing so I knew just where every book was but now all that is gone. This is a huge step backward and now I have $$$$$ tied up in books I can't use/find to read.

    I totally agree with one-star reviewers DCNative and Lindar, this version is a serious disappointment. It took me weeks, as a devoted non-techie (till not sure the purpose of a USB port or where to find one), to figure out how to get WiFi (which is yet another monthly ""fee"" I was happier to avoid), and now I have to re-download everything from my old Kindle because nothing that was allegedly transferred is accessible. The Search feature is impossible to use because the keyboard is mostly unresponsive, and my personal opinion is that a user should not be obligated to jump through a bunch of hoops to suit some nerdy programmer who just wants to see if he's capable of performing some esoteric function to soothe their own ego. ""Improvements"" like these are specifically initiated solely to force Kindle users to buy another device to replace what they already had that was perfectly functional and suited their comfort level, just like getting stuck with a book that turns out to be a cliffhanger. Wise up, Kindle, and good luck to any manufacturer who can come up with an e-reader and doesn't have the ulterior motive of forcing customers to upgrade when they don't want or need to.

    New UX is terrible
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    My Kindle Paperwhite just received a UX upgrade, and I find it to be terrible: in List view, it now uses thumbnails, which means that only 4 items are displayed per a page, which in turn means that scrolling through your items takes at least twice as long. This is very bad if you, like me, have hundreds of times and scroll through them frequently. Amazon believes that it knows better than you what you need and / or want, so there is not an option to go back to the older view or to at least get rid of the thumbnails.Given this, I suggest that you use the Kindle app on your smartphone rather than buy a Kindle Paperwhite: the UX format is basically the same, but there's better performance and it's easier to use on a smartphone. (At least on a Samsung S9.)

As far as bringing anything else up once I finally do get into Wikipedia - forget it.Additionally, I can't go thru the pages of my Library and get back to page one by hitting the home icon - I have to click on the page number at the bottom and go thru that whole process. I don't know how many times I have been using the search function while I was reading and mistakenly hit the back arrow icon instead of X (maybe it's the other way around ...) and left the book I was reading instead of going back to my original page.When I deregistered my 2nd Kindle, I didn't know that I could still read what I had loaded on to it, and I would like to reregister it and load on more, but I'm afraid Amazon would update it like it has my 3rd Kindle.I doubt that you are going to change the things that I have complained about but thank you for the opportunity to voice my displeasure.

    What happened to my KIndle???
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    All the sudden my Kindle became a different device POOF! The home page is completely different and I CAN'T STAND IT! HATE IT! I want my old home screen back. Whoever decided on this needs to lose their job, Jeff. The home page is essentially an unending ad! I didn't buy a Kindle with ads.And there are the other problems I thought I could learn to live with, but really hate. First, how come every generation of Kindle does less than the one before? My Gen 2 had lots of games on it that would not transfer to the old Paperwhite. Now the new Paperwhite will not support any of my games at all. Then there is the tricky, inconsistent touch screen. Sometimes I have to touch three times to get a page to turn. But scrolling through the menus is so touchy that I am constantly opening things I don't want to open. And why does it take so much longer to wake up? The battery does not last as long either. And the battery life indicator on mine has malfunctioned to the point the Kindle essentially shut itself down for lack of power when the indicator said I had 54% power left!It was a big mistake to ""upgrade"" to this new Kindle. The trajectory of Kindles is NOT improving.UPDATE: After two weeks with the new Home page/operating system I can say I completely and utterly despise it. It is intrusive and annoying and there's no getting rid of it. Again, this ploy to try to push content at me is despicable. The way my current book is displayed aggravates me entirely. I HATE IT!!! If I had not invested years and thousands of dollars into Kindle books I would throw the whole thing away today and go back to 100% hard copy books. Yes, I am that outraged!!!

    I was hoping the Kindle Paperwhite 11th generation would be an improvement over previous Kindles.  I have owned 5 kindles, plus purchased others as gifts.  My reason for wanting a new Kindle is that  the interface is difficult to use.  Specifically, the response time is slow or does not respond at all to my touch commands.  I would happily purchase a new Kindle, if the interface were brought up to modern standards.  Unfortunately, reviews of indicate there is no improvement to the interface software.

    Amazon advertises that you can save 20% on a new device if you trade in an old one. I did this and was told my device did not qualify for the promo discount, but they did give me $5 so I know my trade in was accepted. Very misleading.This is what is promoted: ""4.

Promotional discount is limited to one per customer"".After searching for more info on the trade in program, Amazon uses a different term: YOU MAY ALSO""If your submission is eligible for, and you choose to participate in, Instant Payment for your trade-in items, you will receive Amazon.com Gift Card(s) in the amount of the trade-in value at the time you submit a trade-in. You may also receive a limited-time promotional credit towards the purchase of a new qualifying Amazon Device"".

    I enjoyed my old kindle so much, I gave up real books.  However, after years of use, that kindle stopped downloading books, so last October, I bought a replacement.  I can no longer read with one hand, because it lacks a button to turn pages.  If I accidentally touch the screen, pages turn.  There‚Äôs no printed list of books I have downloaded‚Ä¶just small fuzzy pictures of book covers I can‚Äôt read.  Not user friendly at all.  Frustrating to use.

    I have enjoyed my PaperWhite for library books and other purchases. But I have recently been completely soured on all Amazon kindle products because I bought a book written by a friend that was offered as formatted for Kindle, but could never get it to download to my device. Multiple engagements with customer service finally revealed that just because they‚Äôll sell you a Kindle book does not mean that it will be usable on all kindles. WTF is up with that?! If I wanted to read a kindle book on my computer, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought a Kindle. I cannot recommend any of these anymore and I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted with this practice of Amazon.

    This was a gift from my son and I am sorry he paid so much for this frustrating reader. I have used the B&N NOOK for reading for a long time. My original one is a small sized device but still works with no aggravation. Ditto for my second NOOK which also has lasted through many many readings without problems. My son felt the KINDLE might be an improvement because of its brightness and size. How wrong we were.This device freezes frequently in the middle of use. It then requires a waiting period and a complete restart to be used. Often the restart puts you back on page 1 and you must turn pages until you find where you were cut off. So frustrating!Time to go back to using the NOOK.

    I've always loved to read but hadn't really even considered a Kindle. I don't know why I didn't get one sooner. With the ability to checkout books from the library, it's so easy to finish a book and pick up another. I went from reading maybe 3 books a year to having read 5 last month.It's so lightweight that it is easy to hold in whatever position you're most comfortable in. The backlight is excellent in the brightest sunlight or in the darkest room. I'll be transparent - if I didn't use this primarily with library books that are coming and leaving my library, the library portion of the Kindle could be slightly annoying just because you can't freely scroll.It's not worth it to pay the extra money for the ads. It's literally just books being recommended when the screen is locked, and if you buy the leather case for it, it'll be covered up.I love mine and think it's worth every penny!

Once I got it I was struck by the blacker type and its faster speed.  I love it.You may have read on the internet that the Kids version is the same as the Adults but is considerably less expensive.  Maybe so but not on Black Friday when I ordered mine.Minor quibble:  I'm not sure the instruction manual is up to date.  The first book I read on my new Kindle showed all the underlinings from other readers and I didn't know how to clean them off.  I also like seeing the time on each page but it was only on the home page.  I couldn't find answers in the manual.  I contacted Amazon on line and a very helpful customer service person showed me what to do.  (Click on the Aa settings.)  All is now well and I'm happy.

    A very worthy upgrade if you‚Äôre coming from the 7th Gen(2015)
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I love this thing. To be fair, I loved my old kindle too, but this was definitely worth upgrading for. It is everything the product description says it is, no need to repeat that here. My old 2015 7th gen was working 100% but I was tempted when I saw that the new ones had warm amber lighting. It‚Äôs a small thing, but I read mostly at night, in bed, in the dark, while my SO sleeps, and this really does make reading easier on my eyes. And on that point it‚Äôs great. The touchscreen is also a drastic improvement over the 7th gen.The size surprised me. The product descriptions make it clear that this one is about a quarter inch taller and wider, which I didn‚Äôt love, though I definitely do love the bigger screen. But what wasn‚Äôt clear until I had it in hand is that they took back most of that increase with a more minimalist case! So comparing the two products in the case, the new one is the exact same height, about an eighth of an inch wider, and it‚Äôs actually noticeably thinner. I haven‚Äôt taken my old one out of its case in six years, so if you‚Äôre like me then don‚Äôt worry about this, they are are effectively the same size.I can also report, as others have noted, that if you buy the bundle the items ship separately. So the shipping time listed for the bundle is NOT accurate. If you want to know when you‚Äôll get them, look to the individual product pages, those were accurate for me. The bundle said 3-5 weeks, but I got my case in two days, the kindle arrived in four days, and apparently the charging block (I.e. the most useless piece of the bundle) it the only item that will take 3-5 weeks to arrive.

    The amber lighting is much easier on my eyes ( I have at 3/4s on the adjustment scale).

    This is such a clear upgrade from the 2018 edition! I was a bit skeptical at first because I bought the 2018 paperwhite during the prime sale in October 2020. However, I caved in for the better battery, the warm light and bigger screen.What I like so far:The screen is noticeable bigger and it feels strange but a good strange because I love it!I really love how much more responsive the screen is for this e reader! Doesn't seem so cluncky!I love the adjustable warm light feature! You can set the time for warm light automatic or you can manually changed the time!Brightness! This paperwhite clearly is much brighter compared to the the 2018 paperwhite!USB-C charging and wireless charging ( paperwhite signature edition)! Though I wouldn't upgrade to this paperwhite for this feature alone but it's an awesome plus because I swear I have like 20 USB-C cords and like no micro USB cords. With nearly every device using USB-C, this feature is a really good perk!Battery life! Amazon claims 10 weeks with 30 mintues of reading each day. I can comment on the battery life personally for me yet. However, I expect even witu reading for 60-90 mintues, you probably won't have to charge it but once a month! Which is still amazing!!I think the only cons I have about this paperwhite is no option for other colors. I would like to have a choice of a few different colors. Another con is there isn't a 32 gb option for the standard option. You'd have to get the signature edition for the extra storage.Overall, this upgrade is worth the extra $10!!!

    I have been reading books on my iPad mini for years, and have always loved it. However, I‚Äôve started noticing more headaches and wondered if it was possibly from always being in front of a bright screen. I thought it was worth trying the Paperwhite, because from what I read, the e-ink screen would be easier on my eyes. I just received it yesterday, and I am already in love with this thing. It looks great and my eyes seem to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù when I‚Äôm reading on it. Added bonus is that I‚Äôll be able to read outside in the sun this summer, which doesn‚Äôt work with the iPad. Another great thing I hadn‚Äôt even considered is how much lighter it is. Reading while laying in bed is a much more comfortable experience. For those wondering, checking out books from the library is super easy - you do need to use another device to check your books out, but then the app will send it to the Kindle. The one thing that will take some getting use to is the screen refresh when you move around in the system - it threw me off a little when I first saw it, but I get why it does it.  It‚Äôs not nearly as noticeable while reading. Anyhow, great product - I love it, and will update if there is any change down the road. Happy Reading!

    Traded in my Paperwhite from many years ago. This one is even better. Still about the same weight and size but screen area is a bit larger. Screen is more responsive. The viewing is clean and crisp. Battery life is awesome. I have it in a slim case, so it‚Äôs very portable. Would definitely recommend.

    I finally decided to upgrade from the Kindle Keyboard 3rd Gen, and I am so glad I did. The new paperwhite Kindle is light and a joy to read on. I love how responsive the screen is, and how quickly the pages turn. I didn‚Äôt think I would need or like the backlight but its actually proving quite handy (and still feels better than reading on other backlit devices like phones or tablets).

    This is my first Kindle. I wanted to start reading books again this year after many years of not really doing so. I tried reading on my phone (a 13 Pro Max, not something cheap...), but it hurt my eyes after some time. The Kindle Paperwhite feels exactly like reading from the pages of a book as far as my eyes are concerned. Very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for an e-reader.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Originally I ordered the kindle fire 7, but after realizing that I really only wanted the kindle for reading and not the internet or games I decided to cancel the order and get the paperwhite. The battery life is the biggest plus for me! I‚Äôm someone who reads for hours upon hours at a time so the kindle fire with its 7 hours of battery life just wasn‚Äôt going to cut it! I am so in love with my new kindle. If you‚Äôre someone who reads often or in different lighting I would definitely recommend getting a kindle instead of a fire tablet. The paper finish is so much easier on the eyes than the tablet screen. It also has warm light and a night mode for an even more enjoyable experience. I couldn‚Äôt be happier! The only thing I wish it came with is a charging block. With the price point it seems like they could easily include one, but overall it is worth every penny!

    I tried again 5/15 with Japanese text.  After two pages, page would not turn.  After a minute, it restarted.  Finally, it went back to open page.  When I tried to open my Japanese book again, blank screen.  I will have to manually restart.  Since the Japanese text is the main reason I got the new Kindle, I have to give it a 1 and go back to my 2018 Kindle Paperwhite.Twice I had to close the cover to shut down the device, when it stopped responding.  Once, I had to reset it, when the Japanese book I was reading did not open and could not be removed from the device.  But, it  opens books clearly faster than my kindle 10th. It seems to have settled down, but I am keeping the shipping package just in case I decide to return it.9/4/22Still freezing and re-booting way to often.  The 2018 Paperwhite is no better.  I never used to have this problem.  Did they update the operating system or something.  I love my Kindles, but since they started acting  up so much, I am beginning to lose faith in them.

    Large Screen. 100% Better than reading on a Tablet!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Buy a kindle don't settle for a tablet for reading. I've compared them all, wondered whether I would need a bigger screen or whether i'll feel like i'm holding a book. I wanted to know if i'd feel like a good replacement for an actual book reader. I nearly bought a 300$ ink tablet cause I just wanted a larger screen. Then the paper white got upgraded and I though I'd give it a try. I wouldn't come back on my decision. Reading feels effortless. In the dark, in the car or at work. It's luxury really. If you can afford to. Just do it. You won't regret it.

    I am so happy to have gotten this black Friday deal !  I mainly use it for at home reading and night reading! Reading with the warmlight was the selling point for me because I used to read on my Kindle app for this purpose!  I love the schedule warmlight  it's huge for my little hands so I put a popsocket on it to hold! From the picture you can see I have the 2018 paperwhite it's more portable  being that it's smaller  my only con and it doesn't happen often enough is sometimes it freezes and restart and randomly upgrading it's system  but that doesn't bother me I hope in the future will be fixed! I can definitely say that I don't think I'll want the oasis because this is bigger than my  hand and  warmlight is all I desired!  Now my boyfriend wants a kindle since I love my devices so much

    This is my first Kindle and so clearly I am enjoying the fact that I don't need a book light and I don't have to bend the book out to keep the pages open and it's lightweight.  The only complaint I have so far is the battery.  They said the battery lasts 10 weeks depending on how much you read.  I am guessing that it lasts that long if you have it but don't read it at all.  I have owned this Kindle for 5 days and have already had to plug it in twice to charge it.  Granted I have been totally immersed into a series and have barely put the Kindle down,  except for one day I didn't read that much out of it.  But saying it should hold a battery for 10 weeks makes me think that the battery should at least hold for a week of continuous reading.

    An Excellent Paperwhite Update
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    As promised, I am updating this review, now that I have had a few weeks to play with the device.  My rating has changed from 4 to 5 starts, because of the firmware update to version 5.14.1.1 from 5.14.1.  Only a minor update based on version number change, but I have not had lockup issues since the update.  I do not expect to be using my old Paperwhite 2018 again.  I think this is a real winner.I frequently buy discounted books and have since 2009.  The 590 books downloaded take 2.64 GB of the total 6.23 GB available.  So for most people this 8 GB model (the Operating System must take about 1.7 GB) should have more than enough storage.------------------------------------------------------My Kindle Paperwhite 2021 just arrived.Initial impressions.1. It is noticeably faster flipping pages than my Paperwhite 2018.  I put the old and new Paperwhites side by side in the photo with the old one on the left and the new on the right.  I set the font and display formats the same and flipped through a book.  Tapping on them simultaneously, the  delay changing pages is quite obvious on the old model and almost non-existent on the new.  Rapidly tapping the right edge of the 2021 twice flips through 2 pages.  Doing the same thing on the 2018 it only flips one page.  Responsiveness is rapid and accurate moving forward and backwards.  Superior to the 2018.2. The larger active area is very nice.  With a ruler I measure an area increase of about 33%.3. It charges faster than the old Paperwhite.  It arrive with 60% charge and it quickly charged to 90%.4. It booted up with latest Kindle software: Version 5.14.1 (October 2021).  My old Paperwhite 2018 is running version 5.13.7 for comparison.5. It is nice having the display warmth control in addition to the brightness.6. I have had 2 lockups where the only way I could unfreeze was to hold the power button down until it rebooted.  That is the reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5.  The problem occurred when playing with settings and might have something to do with setting extremes on the new Warmth slider and Brightness.  I suspect it is going into the sleep mode improperly, because the screen lighting dimmed, but the page still displayed yet would not change when tapping left or right.  I am guessing Amazon will fix this soon at which point I will raise my rating.My review headline understates the improvement in the Paperwhite.  I own both the 2016 and 2018 models and this is a much more significant set of updates than between the earlier models.  For me, the larger active screen and page turning speed are a big deal.I look forward to using the new Paperwhite and updating this review.

    Warm light feature alone makes it worth the upgrade
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had some version of a Kindle for just about as long as they've been around; as an avid reader I wouldn't be without one now.  I received my new Kindle Paperwhite 11th Gen 8 GB version last week and have already downloaded hundreds of books onto it; knowing I'll never be stuck somewhere without something to read is an amazing feeling, since the larger size still fits into my medium sized purse. I'd worried some about that!Aside from the capacity, my favorite feature hands-down is being able to adjust the warm light depending on the light in the room.  Looking at a bright screen can tire out my eyes and give me headaches, and in a dark room the harsh contrast can really bother my eyes to the point I have to stop reading.  The warm light option has a wide adjustment range and is just perfect for people with sensitive eyes.I was also surprised how ""normal"" the larger size felt shortly after I started using it - more like a book as far as number of words per page - and that it's still so lightweight and easy to hold.It's been a positive experience using it; I was hesitant to upgrade from a perfectly functional older Kindle, but am so glad I did for the above reasons.

    I had this e-ink reader in a sony model years ago.  I bought this for my wife to read in the sun and low light rooms, bedroom etc. The edgelight is excellent and the device smoothly joins the Wi-Fi an allowed her to access our existing Amazon library seamlessly.  I am extremely please with the reader and plan to buy one for myself as well.  This reader replaces a mac - ipad which is probably 3x as heavy and you cannot read the iPad at the beach. With this reader you can.  I recommend this over the base model due to the improved edge lighting which i find easy and eyepleasing .

    This is the best PaperWhite yet. Update
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The latest Kindle PaperWhite, is so much better than the previous PaperWhite. It is so much faster, the upgraded WiFi and screen are just wonderful. I have been using Kindle E-ink devices since I believe 2009. I have had the Kindle KB, the Voyage, and the Oasis 2, and a number of PaperWhites and Basic Kindles. This PW is the best of the group for me. The screen size is great, and it is so easy to see and read on. This PW is so much faster, and page turns are fast and smooth. Downloads almost happen instantaneously.  The updated LED lighting is even across the whole screen. I also received the cloth cover, in blue that matches the cover of my Fire HD 10 plus. When I got the Fire tablet I was expecting to never again get another Kindle E-ink device, but am I so glad that I talked myself into getting this PW. I didn‚Äôt get the special edition because I don‚Äôt need the 32 gigs, and the wireless charging. I am 74 years young and I read close to 100 books a year, most of them are Kindle Unlimited books.For the ones that have complained that this PW doesn‚Äôt do something, like playing games, and some of the other things I have read, let me say this the Kindles, PW, and the Oasis, etc, were all created to be ebook readers, nothing more nothing less. This PW does what it was intended to do so great.I believe that the developers decided to not include the Cellular capability because WiFi has become available almost everywhere, I find that I can find an WiFi HotSpot even where I cannot find Cellular signals.Now I am not someone that jailbreaks my devices even though I could in most cases. I am a retired IT Professional that has chosen to really retire and walk away from the job I use to do.  So I do not wish to were about devices drivers or any of that anymore.After well over a month of use this new Paper White Kindle, I have to say it is the very best Kindle that I have owned, and I have owned basic Kindles, KB, Voyage, and Oasis. This PW5 is fast and very comfortable to use with the Amazon Kindle cloth cover. I highly recommend it.

    Finally, a Kindle that does what I want; hope this review resolves some issues
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've owned several Kindles for various reasons and have found them lacking in speed and navigation. Also, I love to read in the bath. This Kindle resolves all those issues since it's waterproof and much improved. The extra space makes this much more readable. The pages flip as fast as on my Kindle Fire (which is heavier and unpleasant to hold). The lighting is very nice.But there are always bugs whenever something new is rolled out. Here are two I've seen here and tried to resolve on my own Kindle Paperwhite 2021.Software Update grayed out:  in my case, this was because my Kindle came with the latest software.No KindleUnlimited Free 4 Mos: Agreed. I registered my Kindle (actually, according to my account it was registered the day I ordered it). I did not receive a free 4-month Unlimited subscription. An hour of chat with customer support was to say the least frustrating. In the course of that, an email popped up with the free offer - about 18 hours after I registered the device.My only gripe is turning off those damned notes. I don't want to read other people's highlights. I had to Google that since turning them off is no longer available under Reading Options. (At least it wasn't on mine.)This is what you do. Open a book. Go to any page. Tap the top. Under the little house (Home) you'll see the font icon: Aa. Tap that on. A menu will pop up that says Themes Font Layout More. Tap on Moore. Scroll down. Right under ""About this Book"" you'll see Popular Highlights. Slide it off. Phew.Other than that, love this!

    Updated my review to 5 stars. I thought the size was going to bother me, but now I can‚Äôt imagine using the smaller screen! Also not sure why more people aren‚Äôt talking about the page turn animations! I love them!! I sold my previous generation, and now only use the 2021 model.Previous review: I upgraded from a 10th gen paperwhite. While I LOVE all the new features + USB-C charging, I wish they had just left the overall size of the Kindle the same. Instead they should have just made the bezels thinner on the sides and top of the original size. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd notice the small size increase, but it definitely makes it harder to hold even with a popsocket. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be replacing my 10th gen, but using the 10th gen on the go, and 11th gen at home.Remember Amazon, if it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it, aka size of the Kindle!!

    UPDATE:Customer service was great helping me return the original flawed unit I received. Now, that I've spent quite a while using the replacement Kindle I've got (which is perfect now) I can honestly say again that it is the best Kindle I've had to date. The inclusion of the warm light alone is worth it. It allows for a more relaxed reading experience. The size of the screen is way better than the previous model. The weight feels balanced in my hands. Overall it feels like a great step forward. I used to feel the previous model was very cutting edge, but this new 2021 model makes it feel archaic. I hope Amazon continues to astonish with the models it has in store for the future. 100% recommended.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is hands down the best Kindle I've owned out of four different versions. Unfortunately the screen arrived with a line (dead pixels maybe?) where light ""bleeds"" through. It is very distracting, specially when using dark mode. I tried to ignore it, but it definitively breaks the reading immersion.  I'm returning it and hoping I will get a perfect replacement. I will update this review with more details about the device and bump up the stars when this issue is resolved and can spend an honest time using the device.

    I had my last Kindle for 6 years and was honestly a little reluctant to upgrade because if it ain‚Äôt broke‚Ä¶ But 6 years is a long time to hold on to tech, and I‚Äôm so glad I upgraded because this new version of the Paperwhite is amazing. I got so used to my trusty old Kindle being a little sluggish, I was pleasantly surprised at how seamlessly this version ‚Äúturns‚Äù the page. The bigger screen is so nice, and the ability to change the warmth of the backlight in addition to the brightness is spot on; when I‚Äôm reading in bed at night, a dim warm light is a nice option. The only con I‚Äôve found (and it‚Äôs really not a very big one) is the flush screen and the quick page refresh make it easy to accidentally change the page when I don‚Äôt mean to.

    I‚Äôve had a Kindle for a long time (15 years?) and love it. People give me paper books and I thank them but then I check it out from public library; I‚Äôd much rather read, let alone carry around, a Kindle. The paperwhite gives you the superpower of being able to read in the dark. This is my fourth one, the battery finally died in the last one, a gen7 paperwhite. This one is marginally better in several areas but not enough to make it worth an upgrade. If your paperwhite is working, don‚Äôt bother. If your old one isn‚Äôt working or isn‚Äôt a paperwhite buy it now you‚Äôll be glad you did. This new one is slightly larger and doesn‚Äôt fit in the back pocket of dress pants, just jeans.

    This was a wonderful upgrade from my basic Kindle.  I'm glad I waited to get this new edition and didn't settle for the prior edition when the price dropped.As someone who reads 3+ hours a day (I don't watch TV unless it's an episode of Snapped or Top Chef) I will say that the battery life is great and it has been a breeze getting all of the books I've bought directly from authors on BookFunnel onto my new Paperwhite.

    A nearly ""Ideal"" eReader!
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I got this as a gift for my father but set it up beforehand, so I got to test it out and see for myself how it renders out text. Wow! I have to say I was astounded as to how clear and sharp the text is. I and everyone in the family either has or have had a number of e-readers over the years, and this version is a major leap ahead. This is what I think everyone always was hoping for: real PRINT quality display technology!The backlight feature is handy of course and it's nice that they've added more granular steps from ""no light"" to fully lit. The size (of width and length) is essentially what you'd get for a standard paperback book and is very light weight (but not cheap feeling). Personally, I'd love to see a ""trade paperback"" sized version (something around 5"" x 8"") but this one is certainly more than adequate. I haven't been able to truly put the battery life to the test, but experience with other Kindle Paperwhite readers tells me that this one will perform just as advertised.My only wish would be to have the screen another half-inch higher, in order to have some of the controls always ""available"" instead of hidden. That's probably the one aspect of the interface that could be improved; certain settings or functions are not always very intuitive (and I've been using Kindles for years). Still, it's a relatively minor complaint because everything else about this device is amazing.

    In love. I purchased the 2018 kindle 2 months ago and found it so slow and the screen was small. I ended up purchasing the 2021 paperwhite during Black Friday and it‚Äôs such a vast improvement. It‚Äôs super fast, the screen is larger which makes it feel like it can capture an entire physical book page. I removed the ads which makes it more personal. And displayed my cover.  The warm light is great to balance with the brightness. Make sure to turn on screen refresh especially if you enjoy comics or manga. The size is a bit larger, which is hard to hold since I have small hands but I put a clear case, and a clear ring holder in the back and now it‚Äôs absolutely perfect. I have zero complaints. If you are second guessing yourself, don‚Äôt. Just get it üíû

    The perfect eReader?
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Two things. First off, I have been using the new Kindle Paperwhite 11 exclusively the last week or so and I have to say... They may have finally created the PERFECT eReader. Battery life is amazing, the screen looks amazing, the warm light feature is super nice but I tend not to use it because I get sleepyüòÇ, and the page turn animations are snazzy. I wasn't too sure about the size when it first came out because I was afraid it would be heavier, but it's truly not. I have RA and it doesn't hurt my wrist or fingers even after long sessions of holding it while reading. So yeah.... It's super close to being absolutely perfect. I don't really have anything negative at all to say about it at this point, besides I don't care for the flush screens (fingerprints galore) I liked bezels. That's all though.Second, this book is absolutely fabulous.

    At last!  A ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù Paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have owned every single kindle model since the first.  (OK maybe I have a problem, but there it is.) lately I would switch back and forth between the Oasis and the Paperwhite.  I loved the large, brighter screen of the Oasis, but the odd shape bugged me and I only used the buttons about 25% of the time.  I loved the size and shape of the Paperwhite but missed the larger screen and the big fat bezel bothered me.  Finally this is a kindle that, for me, combines the best features of both.  Great size, all the features of the Oasis, thin bezel and clear bright screen.  The battery life seems really good (I have been reading - about 2 to 3 hours a day - for a week and I am still at 66%.  This is IMO the best Kindle yet and I am more than pleased with it.Couple of little points‚Ä¶ It has not updated to the new UI but I am sure it will sooner or later.  Also I was unable to cancel the ads and get cover view (someone else mentioned this) but a call to customer service, who couldn‚Äôt figure it out but entered a ticket for it, put it right within 24 hours.After using it for a few days, one complaint. Yes the power button is STILL on the bottom so when using it propped up or on a stand the device will attempt to power itself off.  Very annoying and with all the updates to this device you would think that moving the button to the top would have been a no brainerJust adding another update:  Today is Nov 8th and I started using this on Oct 29th.  I have been reading around 2 or 3 hours a day (without turning on airplane mode for about half of that AND including downloading samples and books) and it is STILL at 44%.  So the battery life is probably the best I have experienced even including the older paperwhites.  I honestly think that we are heading to 2 week battery life here - something I have seen Amazon claim and have never experienced.Despite the power button placement, I can't find anything to complain about and highly recommend.

    My first kindle was the old school QWERTY keyboard. Then I moved on to the 2016 one. The battery for my first one was noticeably better, however, after so many years, it stopped working, hence the 2016 version. Now I‚Äôve moved onto the 2021 version and it was so worth it. Firstly, it just looks like a much more modern product. It‚Äôs faster, the screen is just as crisp (300ppi), and it uses a usb-c charger which will be a requirement going forward for all products in the European Union (so it‚Äôs also great for traveling - you just need an adaptor for the wall, not a converter as the charger holds 110-240V). The battery life is great as well (can‚Äôt remember vs my keyboard one, but better than 2016 one). This thing really is a beauty. It also chargers must faster than the prior version. From 15% to 100% in probably 3-4 hours. (I plugged it in when it was at 22% and it reached 58% in 40min for what it‚Äôs worth.)I‚Äôll be honest, my 2016 one worked just fine. I just wanted an upgrade this time. And the money back from mailing the old one back was a good push. 5 stars.

    I am on my second Kindle Paperwhite 5 because I didn't like it the first time around. I didn't like it mainly because it was very slippery to hold and the margins are small. It was hard to keep a grip on it.However I decided to give it a second try and I just got a case with a strap on the back and a lap holder that can hold any device. I don't know what it is called but it was only $20 and I love it. I also have a sleeve for when I use just the case with the handle on the back. I love the case that has just the back part too. It makes a difference this time.The second Kindle I got also has no pinholes. That was another issue I had with the first one.I do miss having buttons but I do still have the Kobo Libra 2 for that fix. I have a hard time choosing between which device is better so I am keeping both still.The Paperwhite 5 is still better than the Kindle Oasis ever was to me. It has a better battery life, no ghosting issues and the battery doesn't drain. It's also easier to hold now that I have better accessories.It's a four star rating.

    Goodbye Oasis, I‚Äôll Only Miss Your Buttons (ad update)
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    (Update, lowered one star)I‚Äôm disappointed that ads can‚Äôt be removed from this Paperwhite. I‚Äôve always preferred paying to clean up the interface on my Kindles. It took two days of customer service calls to finally clarify that this device doesn‚Äôt qualify for ad removal. That‚Äôs disappointing. Otherwise, my original review below stands(End update)I‚Äôve had and loved many Kindles since generation 2.6 inches is a little small nowadays, though, especially with big phones. I use the Kindle app on my iPhone Max a lot, and it‚Äôs nice and keeps the Kindle in the drawer most days, but I‚Äôm still much more likely to really get lost in a book and not get distracted with a Kindle. And besides the lack of distraction, e-ink screens are still uniquely pleasing to the eye and touch.I‚Äôve enjoyed my Oasis for a couple years now. I love the bigger screen and the page-turning buttons, but I don‚Äôt love that there‚Äôs almost no pocket in the world that can hold it.The new Paperwhite is a great screen size AND it fits in my pockets! I was worried that I wouldn‚Äôt like the smaller bezels on it. I like big bezels. The giant bezel on the Oasis is just dreamy to me, but I‚Äôm finding that this Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in multiple ways without accidental screen touches, so I l‚Äôm happy they found an excellent balance between device size, screen size, and bezel size.The page turns are the zippiest I‚Äôve ever experienced on a Kindle.Being able to balance the two types of lighting is not essential to me, but I like it.Otherwise, if you know Kindles, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything else new and exciting to report. I love it. Thanks, Amazon!

",2.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite in May and was impressed with the ad that the battery life lasted longer than the previous model.  Well it doesn't.  I am constantly charging the Paperwhite and I do turn it off when not in use but doesn't seem to matter.  The biggest ""gripe"" that I have with this Kindle is that it is difficult (at least for me) to make the screen move.  I hold it tapping and tapping and using up the battery trying to find the home screen and the library.  I am following the directions but this home page just doesn't move and that is frustrating. I think 1 out of 50 may work as advertised and I got the 51 that doesn't!  I read the books on my computer waiting for the Kindle Paperwhite to charge when in the middle of a great story. Would appreciate any suggestions.

    Huge Upgrade from the 2012 Paperwhite
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I upgraded to the new model from a 2012 Paperwhite, and as expected, I've found this one to be a major leap forward.  The screen is sharper, with more even lighting, the added size is great, and it's very much more responsive than the old one. Slow page turns were annoying on the original Paperwhite, and that's gone in the new model. I loved the Amazon leather cover on my old one, and the new cover (fabric this time) is even better. My one minor complaint is that there seem to be fewer font size choices. I'm currently fine with the medium setting, but if I have to increase, the next size up is much bigger.For those running into issues with ads, I hit that as well - trying to turn off ads from the Devices page would just fail with a ""try again later"" message.  I contacted the chat support, and the rep resolved this for me in a matter of minutes.

    Love it and definitely could love it even more
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    First of all let me state the obvious, this is an e-reader. This is not a tablet nor a mini laptop. If you‚Äôre interested in reading books and okay with reading magazines that aren‚Äôt in color (for the articles vs pictures), this device will help you do that in e-form.I started my Kindle journey with the very first Gen 1 and we have come a LONG way since then. Yes, there are certainly still minor things that can be improved upon however for all intents and purposes this is a wonderful device for what it‚Äôs meant to be used for.I have had zero issues with battery life. I am a binge reader in terms of off work days I read for hours and on work days I read for snatches of time here and there through my day and evening. I have charged the device from approx 5% to 100% maybe every week and a half or so. With the current charger it does take some time to get to a full charge so being able to upgrade to a lightening charger would be chef‚Äôs kiss. Alas since that is not yet an option I either allow my eyes the time off screen from reading to allow it to fully charge, charge overnight, or I switch over to my Kindle app on my cell while it‚Äôs charging.The ability to borrow ebooks from the library, purchase kindle editions of just about any book I would want directly from my Amazon account or use Kindle Unlimited offers a ton of options. If you sub to KU it more than pays for itself with just a book or two ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù. The price of Kindle books for purchase can vary. I have noticed that the YA and Adult fantasy/romance/dark academia genre I prefer can vary from maybe $7.00-ish on down (often even having temp markdowns to $0.99 here and there). Then there is the flip side, when I want non-fic or contemporary reads I have noticed they often stay upwards around the same price (or within a few dollars of) as a physical copy. In those instances I will often pass on buying and either wait for the library loan to be available or purchase the physical copy if it is one I want for my physical collection.The options for lighting (brightness/warmth) are lovely. I read in bed most nights and adjust the lighting so as not to disturb my husband but also so as not to strain my eyes or mess with my brains ability to know when it should sleep. The brightness gets very bright! And you can dim it fairly low while adjusting also the warmth to make it still comfortable to read but not causing sleep disturbances of other people in the same area.I have taken it on a few car trips and even on bright and sunny days it acts as paper just as advertised so there is no glare from the screen causing issues with being able to read, including when the sun is beaming directly upon the device.It is lightweight and for my hands east to hold. I love that it is waterproof so I can read in the tub without concern or even near a pool without worry of being splashed on.I am not sure yet on the selection of covers. I do recommend buying one with your device as it offers protection to your screen, although if you‚Äôre careful a nicely padded book sleeve would work well and probably offer so many more options for patterns, if that is your thing. I stuck with a basic blue Amazon cover. The device popped right in and stays secure. I have had to take it out only once since purchase and it was still easy to remove from the case despite being a secure cover. I cannot attest to if older gen of paperweight covers would also fit this, check dimensions of both to be sure unless you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt mind the chore of returning items later.As I stated previously in this review, I have had a few different generations of the first kindles as well as at least 2 generations of the Kindle Fire. Thus far I prefer the Paperwhite to a Fire because I am looking for an e-reader only. The tablet ability of a Fire is far too distracting even though I love that it‚Äôs in color. The color screen was the only thing I preferred.Now please do not get it wrong, there is room for improvement such as touchscreen response, adding color option, doing away with the ads without having to pay more when you‚Äôre already purchasing the device and thus will be purchasing or downloading borrowed books by way of library or KU. It would also be nice if the interface was more intuitive and not so ‚Äúclunky‚Äù when you‚Äôre moving around the library. Perhaps even options to have various ‚Äúshelves‚Äù similar to the Fire where my read books can be moved to a shelf and my TBR can be moved to another shelf (or however one would prefer to organize them).Another small issue is this is a waterproof device but when I have had a very small amount of water (like a literal drop or two) on the touchscreen it is not only not reactive but stays frozen for quite a bit of time. I have noticed that if I close the cover of hit the button to make it sleep and leave it for a few seconds it is fine when I awaken it and can once again swipe with no problem.I cannot yet attest if I would have preferred the 32gb in terms of if the 8gb being able to hold my ebook collection or not but that is something I am determining for future me. I do prefer the wireless charging capability of the 32gb and wonder why they don‚Äôt make the 8gb also wireless charging, especially in light of so many reviews complaining about not having usb-c or lighting ports.I also have my eyes on the Oasis, however that price really puts me off because I do still have a massive physical book collection that I am adding to all of the time. Perhaps one day if I decide to stop adding to that collection I could foresee the $299.00 price tag but for now having that side bevel and the external page buttons isn‚Äôt enough of an improvement for me to fork over that money. One day perhaps if I see some additional improvements based on the flaws pointed out by many reviewers so for now I stick with and absolutely love the Paperwhite.

    For the money, the newest Kindle Paper White is awesome. I've owned nearly all the Kindles since the first generations. I have an Oasis, and while the form factor is great overall... I prefer the Paper White. I don't like the buttons on the Oasis and the weight is offset switching from my left and right hands without rotating the device. The 2021 Paper White is symmetrical making it easier to switch between my hands without rotating the device and has a little better battery life.The screen on my Oasis is a little clearer though... probably because the glass is more transparent. The 2021 Paper White has a plastic screen... more susceptible to scratches, but less prone to breaking if dropped or carried around in a bag... pick your poison. I prefer the glass, but that's obviously not an option on the 2021 Paper White.My Oasis is a 1st Gen, and has a bluish backlight. I don't think it is worth he $250+ asking price to get the latest generation with a yellower backlight (the form factor is exactly the same). However, for the Price of the Paper White, it was worth it to me... I get the yellow/blue backlighting, better battery life, and the symmetrical form factor I enjoy.

    I purchased this for my wife as she needed a waterproof device for the spa/hot tub.  Frankly I have Kindle envy as the slightly larger screen and better letter definition really makes a nice difference.  Now that I‚Äôm not traveling as much the larger size is less of a detriment, though only some of my sport coat pockets are wide enough to support its size.  The extra $30 savings for Kindle Unlimited on top of the sale price made this an excellent value.  Overall an excellent purchase for someone who is newly retired from 50 years in nursing and is a prodigious reader.

Physical Differences- 2021 charging port is USB-C vs microUSB my older 2017 .- 2021's screen is completely flush like a smartphone and the 2017 has bordered plastic housing.- 2021's Kindle front logo's font color on the bezel chin is dark gray and the 2017 is a black gloss color (think black car with black aftermarket rims. I actually liked this more than 2021).- 2021's dimensions are slightly bigger with thinner bezels for more reading and less page turning.- 2021's housing is surrounded by a more firm rubber Velcro feeling texture than the older model.2. Battery Life- 2021's screen has been on for about 15 minutes not and the battery has not dropped yet. Can't say the same about the older model since its a few years old.3. Software- 2021's more up-to-date CPU wins but its not night a day which may be due to e-ink technology. Don't expect some kind of M1 MacBook or AMD 5 series GUI (interface) responsiveness if this is your first e-ink device.- 2021 has dark mode and Bluetooth. These are new features for me and I'll figure out how to make best of the new tools.First impression thoughts: Minor upgrade overall but I knew that going in. I'm not a fan of the extra real estate but I'll learn to live with it. If you're a frequent traveler, I'd stick to the older models for easier travel storage (interior coat pocket to fanny packs). To me, personally, it isn't worth the 130.00+ retail especially only if you don't already have a previous gen. If you haven one yet then this year's model is worth it for the USB-C and better battery life- just wait on a good holiday deal. I got mine today with a price discount from last week plus additional discounts by trading in my 2017 for 20% off + 25.00 Amazon Credits.

    The Paperwhite I have been hoping for
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I have been a Kindle user since generation one.  I've loved them all for what they were but this Kindle finally made me say ""YES!  THANK YOU, AMAZON! THIS IS THE ONE!!""The screen is a little larger, it's waterproof, the touch screen works better than any of the other Kindles I've had and I can adjust my reading experience in more ways than ever now (brightness and fonts as I always could but now I can adjust the light warmth too)  I it charges quickly (finally a better charging cord).  I love it!!

    Coming from my Kindle Paperwhite 2013 (6th generation) this was a massive improvement. I love the larger screen, warm tint and dark mode, which is very important for nighttime reading. The screen resolution is great, with crisp, clear font, the screen lighting is uniform and the navigation is so much faster. Battery life seems great too, I‚Äôve been reading for five days and downloading books daily and the battery still has 60% left- with the WiFi turned on. I really have no complaints and expect to get many years out of this Kindle.

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I'm upgrading from a previous Kindle Touch (4th Generation), so this is a great improvement with the in-screen light and other functionalities, however the touch screen is a bit glitchy and will sometimes freeze. Only way to get back to reading is a full restart with reload (see picture, typically reloading lasts a few minutes). Hope there is a software update soon. Otherwise the kindle feels great in hand and love that there is finally a USB-C charging port.Only thing holding me back from a 5-star rating is the software glitches. Constantly having to restart after a few setting changes or even sometimes randomly is incredibly disruptive and unfortunate. I want to love it, but not yet!Update: Received a new Kindle and it is working perfectly. Updating my review to 5 stars.

    I‚Äôm not sure why I waited as long as I have to buy a Kindle but I absolutely love it. Shipping did take much longer than I had expected but I‚Äôm also very impatient. I don‚Äôt have any prior models to compare it to but as an avid user of much larger tablet devices I will say the Kindle‚Äôs features make reading such a breeze! It‚Äôs lighter than my current cell phone and the adjustability of the screen and the many options you have for visibility is very accommodating. I have yet to read outside due to the current temperatures but I‚Äôm looking forward to hitting the hammock come spring and being able to read without a glare! Lastly, I wouldn‚Äôt say I have small hands, I guess average for a woman, but I did add a phone grip to the back and it has made a world of difference in holding the Kindle more comfortably. If you‚Äôve read this far, just buy it! You won‚Äôt regret it!

    I had the 2018, which I absolutely loved. My reading increased 300%. The only complaint I had was the screen took a moment to respond. It was frustrating only when I needed to type or access a book. Page-turning was tolerable, but switching books was inconvenient.This one reacts much quicker and it even feels like I don't need to press hard at all. Single-handed page turning is a breeze. The screen is also noticeably larger, but it's still super light and easy to hold one handed. The warm light has a schedule too, if you want, and I love that. I'm so glad I upgraded.

    This works great once you are reading.  At night if you want to turn the screen black you can change it to black to read.  I just keep learning as I go.  I think part of it is I bought a horrible book to read first.  It makes me not want to read at all.  I have to get another book.  Practice with that book.  I do like the kindles battery life.  I have only charged it once in I guess a month.  I think that is pretty cool.  My other kindles were very needy and the battery was crying to be charged.  I hope this last a long time.

    I was debating upgrading to this kindle from my 2017 paperwhite and I‚Äôm glad that I did! I love the larger screen and that the screen is flush and not in-set in the devices, so no more dog hair gets stuck in it. The warm light setting is a game changer for reading before bedtime if you have sensitive eyes like me. My only complaint is that the screen acquires smudges fairly easily. Not a big deal but I catch myself getting distracted by them when I‚Äôm reading. I paired my kindle with the lavender haze case which is cute and comfortable. I recommend upgrading if you‚Äôre on the fence like I was. This device fixed every complaint I had about my previous 2017 model.

    I'm very pleased with my purchase. I've debated for years on whether or not to get an e-reader at all. I made the decision to try to spend less on books and I believe that having this Kindle will help me do that. I have not seen a 10-week-long battery life just yet but it does last quite long. I've charged it once since I received it Dec. 3. I really enjoy all the features this new Paperwhite comes with especially the USB-C and the adjustable warmth light. I decided on just getting a skin instead of a cover and I'm happy with that. It's a little wide for my tiny hands but it works just perfect. üòã I enjoy the reading experience on this device more than I ever did on a tablet or my phone. Besides my red dragon plush that my mother got me this is my favorite Christmas present.Cons: I don't like that the power button is on the bottom. When I put it on a stand it cuts on and off. I don't know why they didn't put the power button on the side or the top. Hopefully they will move the power button to a more convenient spot in future versions.

    I bought the generation 11 to replace my 3rd generation. I had my eye on this for a while when it went on sale during the recent prime day. Couldn't resist.This is obviously much improved over my old one. I was a little disappointed that the text doesn't seem as black as the 3rd generation. After adjusting text settings it's more comfortable for me. I love the lighted display, there are a lot of settings to get it to how you like it. I'm still playing with it, it's way different than my old one but in a good way. I'm not very tech savvy but find navigating settings is pretty straight forward.Can definitely recommend if you have an older version and want to upgrade, I'm very happy with it.

    My favorite device for outdoor reading
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    This new Kindle Paperwhite 2021 is the latest in this line of eReaders, with a few key upgrades over previous versions.  As an avid reader of Ebooks, I am always looking for the most comfortable devices to read on, so I was very excited to try out this newest model.  Here are my thoughts so far:Notable upgrades from previous version:--6.8‚Äù Display:  previous version was 6‚Äù--USB-C charging: previously was micro-USB.  Also now 10 weeks of battery life with 2.5 hour charge--Faster:  quoted as 20% faster page loading--Brighter:  10% brighter at max brightness, also can adjust ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù setting of screen to your preference.So far, I have enjoyed the larger screen, and this Paperwhite looks nice and bright even on sunny days outside.  I obviously appreciate the long-overdue upgrade to USB-C charging, and so far the battery life seems great.  I can notice a slight speed difference, I'm not sure if I would've said that it feels like it is 20% faster though.  The ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù setting bar can shift the color from more of a bluish to a more yellowish tone, on a slider bar.  I'll have to test it out more, but so far my eyes seem to prefer reading with the brighter bluish tone.Overall, the biggest deal for me is having a nice sized screen that is easy to read even in the brightest environments.  The waterproof IPX8 rating is nice too, as it makes me feel more comfortable reading outside without worrying about getting it wet.  For outdoor reading, nothing really compares to this Kindle Paperwhite and the more expensive Kindle Oasis, as since this is less expensive than the Oasis, it is now my favorite reading device.  I look forward to hours of reading outside on this nice bright screen, and I will update this review if I notice any other important details over time.

    I waited a long time to buy my first Kindle. I have been reading on my iPhone and iPad for a long time, and now I can save the batteries on those things!This is lightweight and a great size, and I love using it. Winter is here, so I probably won‚Äôt take this outside to read much, but I already find the anti-glare to be beneficial with the various light sources around me. Setup was easy, and how-to resources are easily accessible right inside the device‚Äôs settings.After about 6 weeks I started to notice that the bottom corners have been getting loose, and I don‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs like the screen is separating from the back of the device by a small margin and I have to pinch the corners to put them back in place. It worries me that this is happening so soon after buying. I have really enjoyed my experience, otherwise.

    Okay so it‚Äôs only been a few weeks and it works great I haven‚Äôt needed to charge often. I got to sync the kindle app on my phone with my kindle and it works great. I keep reading anywhere and don‚Äôt lose my place in a book. That being said I found it more enjoyable because I had kindle unlimited. Which is good for testing out books before buying the physical hardcover or paperbacks. I haven‚Äôt changed the lighting because the current setting doesn‚Äôt bother me. Now like any product extras come separately. You need to buy the wall outlet separately, the case and the screen protectors just like you would for any computer or phone. I like the size of it. And it‚Äôs not heavy, very light weight. The touch screen is okay, its not anything fancy but I don‚Äôt hate it. So far so good, I‚Äôm hoping they do a color one in the future but that‚Äôs simply for aesthetic reasons rather than anything else. Price wise I would say you get what you pay for. I got it on sale for Black Friday and doing monthly payments, my first time trying out that feature. Compared to a nook, which costs about maybe thirty dollars less and other than a color screen does not offer an unlimited reading plan so you have to buy the books or get only the  free books which aren‚Äôt usually by very well known authors. Since I have both, I will say I‚Äôve used my kindle more in the first three weeks than my nook. Definitely worth a try.

    This is my third or fourth Paperwhite. It's bigger, faster and lighter than the previous generations. Pages turn faster. Well, everything is faster. The user interface is a little clunky and there's an annoying learning curve. Not that well thought out, IMO, but it's still worth the trouble. Amazon dropped the ball on the cases to protect it so you may wish to look around for something that doesn't require you to auction off your first born child to pay for a case that is just not up to par.

    I have had Kindles in the past and then I transitioned over to a Fire tablet for a bit... I hated reading on it, there were too many ads and the battery life was bad. This kindle is great! The battery life is amazing, it is light weight and so easy to read on. I am loving it so much and the Paperwhite is so easy on the eyes. Would recommend to any reader.

    Have always been ""I prefer the actual physical book in my hands' girl  - but not now
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I am a bookworm but over the last few years I've noticed I've not read any physical books. I've listened to the Audible version of many many many books and had usually always read the physical book itself as well. I read almost exclusively self-help books. So hearing the book and then following up with reading it helped really absorb/remember important points.At first, I thought it was it was because I was gradually just relying on the Audible version that was lending to me not reading. But when I really thought about it, I realized that when it'd come time to leave the house I'd decide against taking the book with me. (I haul around a lot of stuff so that's just one less thing that would take up space in my computer bag).Anyway and ultimately, I thought I'd try the Kindle Paperwhite and I'm SO HAPPY I did. I've already read 2 books after getting my kindle on Oct 27th.It's important to note I've always been a hardcore ""I have to have the physical book' girl. However, with the ability to change fonts (makes the world of difference to me - not sure why), having so many screen options and (LOVE this next part) the highlighting that you can print off, I'm just totally in love with this thing. Hmmm, that means I should probably give her a name:)And it's so lightweight! And since it doesn't take up much space and isn't heavy or bulking it's no big deal to have it everywhere I go.I read a crap ton of reviews and many had mentioned battery life. The battery life has proven PHENOMENAL.As far as the ease of holding it - I think that sticking a pop socket on the back will probably make it the most comfortable for me personally. It's not that it's hard to hold at all, but I'll catch that my hand is getting tired if I'm 'one-handing' it just because it's a wider grip.P.S. I never write reviews even though I've purchased a million items on Amazon. But, reviews ALWAYS help me and I was impressed enough to want to write one. So I hope this helps someone.

    I have the 10th generation Kindle and though I really enjoyed it, I didn't realize just how much of a difference a slightly larger screen and less bezels can actually make! I'm only two days in but I am obsessed with it. It's light which makes it easy to hold, and overall an awesome experience it. I recommend upgrading but it's not necessary. Or at least wait for when it's discounted :)

    I just received my new Paperwhite three days ago. I pre ordered it. My Gen 6 was constantly rebooting itself, poor old thing. But I had gotten a ton of use out of it. I had read the reviews on the last one and heard some concerns so I waited for the Gen 11. I have used it for three days and love it!!  I thought 0.8‚Äù difference on the screen size wouldn‚Äôt be noticeable, but it is. I read a lot in the pool on a float in the summer so being waterproof is big (although I do have a cover it will fit it if I go to the beach, for water and sand). The warm light is so nice on the eyes, and it has a function to switch it as the sun goes down. How convenient. My kindle goes to doctors appointments with long waits, to the airport, with longer waits. Fits right in my bag, and I am always entertained (without reverting to social media‚Ä¶.which stresses me out!). Paperwhites are always my favorite because the screen is not backlit, which us hard on my eyes after a long time. Loving it already!!!!

    Better Reading Than Kindle Oasis
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I like my Kindle Oasis 2019 but it doesn't hold a charge.  When I read a lot in a day I am apt to have to recharge twice and, on normal days, recharge every day.  So I thought I'd give the Paperwhite 2021 a whirl.  I didn't expect the Paperwhite to be this good, but it is.  I LOVE it!  One, it is slight, iighter, easier to hold, less clunky.  I don't go anywhere without my Kindle.  The Paperwhite 2021 is easier to cart around.  Two, who needs those Oasis page-turner buttons when a quick and slight tap on the screen does the job?  Three, the display is larger than the earlier Paperwhites.  Though not as large as the Oasis, its almost as large and, in my opinion, quite perfect and better than earlier Paperwhites.  Four, the adjustable warm light is very nice.  The newest 2021 Oasis also has this feature but.....the price for the new Paperwhite is lower.  Now, I'm not sure how long a charge will last because it arrived just yesterday.  I'll update my review when I figure that out.  (I do use Airplane mode to protect the charge).  In sum, with the Paperwhite 2021 I found my perfect Kindle and prefer it to the Oasis.

    Would have given 5 stars but the side bezels are too narrow to hold comfortably, and the power button should be at the top.

The text is sharp and response is fast. The 4 months of free Kindle Unlimited is generous.

All my books automatically showed up instantly on my new Paperwhite without any problems at all. I don't know how or why some reviewers seem to have problems setting theirs up. Maybe they just can't deal with simple technology. Anyway I highly recommend this new 2021 Kindle Paperwhite it's awesome.

I missed reading and ever since I got my Kindle I read every other day at least and don't look at my phone so much!

    I love this device. I've always wanted a bigger screen for my e-reader and this new paperwhite has just that. I updated from my 2nd generation paperwhite so I love that this one has a flushed screen. I haven't reached 0% on the battery so I don't know how long it lasts but I've read positive reviews saying that it's insanely long so I'm looking forward to it. The page turning is noticeably faster and the warmth adjustment is really nice too. I love that I can save my favorite font, font size, text spacing as a ""theme"". I read in both English and Vietnamese and the text in Vietnamese is always tighter so having this theme option is really convenient since I don't have to readjust the font or spacing every time. Overall I really love this device and would recommend it for anyone who wants to update from the 3rd or previous generations of paperwhite or from a normal kindle. If you currently have the 4th generation I don't think it's worth the update since it's quite expensive.

    I like that it's light weight comfortable to hold.  All my books are in one place, and it has a long battery charge for reading ebooks,  uses up power playing audiobooks.  Using a Kindle reader there are no distractions just reading or listening to a book.  No multitasking on tablet, phone or computers.Vouce View Screen Reader function is challenging.  To use after pair your head phones and before turning on VVS, open your library and select the Kindle book you want to read. Open the section you want to read.  Then pull down menu, go to Settings and select Assessibility.  Select VVS and turn on.  Return to back to listen to it read aloud as text to speech use to do.

    If you're like me, you are getting pretty tired of looking at the stack of books that are spilling onto the floor. My husband bought me a Kindle and I wasn't thrilled. I love the feeling of a real book in my hands, so I thought Id hate this. I was so wrong. This holds, reads, and feels like a book (with the foldable cover- sold separately) I love to read in bed at night, and my traditional book light is so bright and likely contributes to my insomnia. The Kindle has both a day and night feature with controlled brightness. It has a warm and subtle backlight. With Kindle Unlimited, I've been able to transfer several of my traditional bound books to my Kindle for $9 per month.

    Fast, Nice Screen Size, Really Like it
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update:I'm very happy with the Paperwhite.Amazon sent new unit, and it automatically updated to new software shortly after I set it up.As stated previously, it's very fast, I like the screen size, it's easy on the eyes, lightweight & easy to hold, and I'm glad they changed to the USB-C connection so I can use the same wire that I use for my phone. I've been reading more than I had in a long time now that I have it.Update:After reading all reviews, it's obvious that I received a Paperwhite with old software, as a number of other people did as well. My device info shows Firmware Version 5.14.0.1, but from reviews I've read outside of Amazon, I believe the new version is 5.14.1.  I contacted customer service, and they are sending a replacement, which the agent said ""should"" have the new software on it. Let's hope that those of us who are getting replacements do receive units with the correct updated software.I've decided that I do like it much more for reading than my Kindle 8 in spite of the old software.I will update my review again after receiving the new one.---------------Previous Review:Kind of disappointed. I've loved all of my Kindles, and really wanted to love my first Paperwhite.First the good:The screen size is nice.The screen is easy on the eyes.It's light weight for comfortable holding.The USB-C is great - no more searching for the right wire.It's fast.Now the not so good:UI does not look like what is shown on Amazon's Paperwhite 2021 product page. Their photo shows the ability to swipe down on the top of the screen to access the menu, but mine has a top menu that doesn't go away on the Home screen.  No up or down swiping inside a book either - you need to tap the upper part of the screen to access the menu. You can only swipe left or right to turn pages.  And if you accidentally touch the screen anywhere other than the top when reading, it will go to the next page, which is infinitely annoying.Also, Amazon's photo shows navigation at the bottom of the screen to switch between Home, Library or the book you are reading, but mine has no such feature. That is something I would have liked to make navigation more convenient.The Paperwhite doesn't seem to have page turn animation, or at least I can't find the setting for it, and neither could an Amazon rep who spent almost an hour on the phone with me regarding my issues.  I realize this is my own personal preference and may not matter to other people, but it makes a difference to me. That's one thing I loved about reading on my Fire 8 - it gives the sense of reading a real book, but the Fire 8 is too slow even after cleanup and reboot, and takes forever to load a book. It's also a bit too heavy to hold for long periods of time. Although Amazon does not actually mention page turn animation in their description, according to two reviewers on Amazon, and also two independent reviews elsewhere, they do have animated page turn on their new 2021 Paperwhites. So I'd like to know how I can enable it on mine.Two buyers commented in their reviews that they received units with old software but couldn't update to the latest version as the update option is greyed out. It's greyed out on mine as well, which I initially assumed meant that I already have the latest software, but now I'm wondering whether that may be the issue with mine. Maybe I really don't have the latest version of the software, but I can't update it.I really had high hopes for the Paperwhite, but as of now I'm on the fence as to whether I'll keep it or go back to using my Fire 8 for reading. If I can get these things resolved, I'll happily come back to add stars and update my review.

I added a popsocket to the back of mine to make it even more comfortable to hold. I recommend for any avid reader!

    I gave this Paperwhite 5*s because so far I like it!!!!  I have had several kindle‚Äôs, my last Paperwhite being a 7th generation.  I was completely satisfied with my 7th generation but wanted something newer so I ordered the new 11th generation Paperwhite. Glad I did.I have to say that the viewing area does seem to be the perfect size. The lighting is soothing or more book like or less harsh, etc. Can't really put my finger on it other than to say reading seems effortless. I have been checking the 11 against my 7 side by side and it's a huge improvement.  I like it.I have not experienced fuzziness or any of the other reviewers  issues but have only had my 11 for a few days.The waterproofing and ability to listen to audio via blue tooth are not high on my list of e-reader priorities but they're nice to have.The software upgrades are a huge improvement.  But of course they are also available on my 7 for the most part. The 11 screen does seem to be more responsive than on my 7 despite it having the same software updates.I am happy I made the move to the 11 and you will be too. Try it you'll like it!!BTW I did not buy the kindle cover but I did buy another vendor‚Äôs cover. I highly recommend buying a cover for your device. I do not enjoy reading on my kindle without a cover it makes it feel more book like to me but that's really just personal preference.  If you buy a cover make sure it's for the 11th generation as covers  for earlier generations will *not* fit.All in all I üíï  my new 11th generation Kindle Paperwhite and you will too.

    Finally decided to upgrade from my 2011 Kindle and all I can say is that I am very glad that I did. The upgrades are so much better considering there is a 10 year gap between both devices. Definitely recommend those who have much older models to upgrade or if you‚Äôre new to kindle. It feels great to be able to read in the dark and have touch screen. Overall very happy with my purchase, no complaints.

    Crisp brilliant display, long battery life and a very comfortable holding weight. Amazon doesn‚Äôt mess around with it‚Äôs kindles. They are designed to be the best, and to give you the best user experience. Amazon happens to hit the mark on all of those things. Not only that, but I‚Äôm really enjoying having the warm light implanted into the new era of kindles. As you can see from my picture hopefully, the text is amazingly crisp and sharp. Page turns are nice and quick‚Ä¶. And battery life is really outstanding. I would highly  recommend this unit to everyone. Oh, and having the USB-C charging port is also a welcome feature over the old kindles. Can‚Äôt go wrong with purchasing one.

I can still have blurry vision when I use it for a few hours but the strain is much less pronounced.  It's light weight and easy to use.  The only issue I  have is getting back to the home screen,  the kindle keeps opening the books information, so it takes mea few tries to get it right.

    I guess I just expect more.  I had to edit this review after looking at my ""Goodreads"" account.  Goodreads tracks the books that you've read on your Kindle.  Since March of 2020 I have read 290 books.  Accept for professional ""reviewers"" or editors I guess that's an awful lot more than the average person has read.And, while that doesn't seem overdone to me I imagine it would to many.  However, the fact remains, the battery life is not nearly as long as Amazon would have you believe, 10 weeks, that is such a wrong statement, unless you only read for 15 - 30 minutes a day, then perhaps it will last that long though I doubt it.  If you're an avid reader be prepared to plug it in at least every other day.  The response time, for page turning, or anything is slow.  The last 2 updates are trash and make the Kindle Table of Contents even slower, The Table of Contents is bulky and unwieldy.  Seriously, it's easier and better to look at book covers as opposed to just the title???  As for a color Kindle - again, seriously are your books in color?  Why does the Kindle need something else to go wrong?  Intuitive - no way are these updates intuitive, response time is slowed to unbelievable levels.  I've lost track of how many times I've had to restart my Kindle, It's a year and a half old.  Yes, I do read a lot, between 2 - 3 hours per day.  My kindle has to be charged every 3 - 4 days at the most.  There used to be a Kindle ""forum"".  Doesn't exist any longer - too many complaints I believe.  Now you will get no response from Amazon (except lip service - - - maybe) no matter what your comment.  I use a Kindle because I ""need"" to read, I have issues with my hands and can not hold a hardcover book - - hence I 'm sorry to say I depend on the Kindle.  In one of the reviews, the reviewer had some similar complaints.  The reviewer also said he received a ""call"" from the developer??!? Not sure how that happened since on the site there there no Tel # nor was there a reply from any developer, nevertheless I had hoped that was a true statement and that changes would come about deleting the horror of the last 2 updates.  That hasn't happened -

    I never intended on buying another Kindle.  Along came Prime Day.  I grabbed this for about 100 bucks.In terms of the need of wireless charging for this?  You have to be kidding.  The battery life is go good on this (I read a novel and used 12 percent of battery) that connecting it once every 4-6 weeks is hardly an inconvenience.  I am thrilled without this option.I'd like to offer a comparison between this Paperwhite and the Kobo Sage.  There is not a better engineered EReader for holding in the hand than that one.  It's expensive.  Where the Kindle wins is clearly in battery life.  Kobo wins with the user experience,  however it's battery life is disappointing and in line with the 1st EReaders introduced.  But unless you are on a lengthy period away from charging - this is a non issue.The best bang for the buck??  Paperwhite.  If you have never owned one, or want to upgrade?  You will not be disappointed.If money is no object, the Kobo Sage is the premier EReader right now.  Despite its shortcomings, it's difficult to forget its ease in library borrowing,  as well as the amazing feel in hand.  Amazon still has not gotten that quite right.  Not by comparison.

    I love, love, love my KIndle.  And I love this Paperwhite. Not only can I take my entire library with me and only carry the single device, but I can program it so that reading is like picking up the hard over or paperback -- a creamy colored background with black type -- and adjust more than just backgrounds and type. A battery that lasts 12 hours or more gives me ample time to read a book before I need to recharge. A brilliant piece of technology and mine is no exception. I love it. I still love my hard covers and paperbacks but having this with me is easy and convenient.  I love my Kindle!!

",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I had the previous generation Paperwhite which I have loved and used a lot. I'd imagine that I average about 1-2 hours of reading per day. The battery life in my 2019 Paperwhite was really dwindling. In fact, if I was reading with the wifi on, I would not expect more than 12 hours of battery life.  It had been a great device that would occasionally need to reboot for no apparent reason, but it was time to replace it.So far, I am thrilled.It is so much more responsive to touch than the last version. I hated typing anything on my kindle and only did when I needed to search for a book in the kindle store. Typing had been so slow and laggy, and often a letter would not be recognized.This is no longer as big of a problem. It obviously is more sensitive to input by typing, and highlighting is far quicker and more accurate.Page turning is so quick, at times I am wondering if the page even turned. Because of this, Kindle has implemented a page turning animation that actually helps you see the page turn. At first, I thought the page turn animation would just be a gimmick, but it actually is necessary because of how responsive the page turn feature is.Being a bit larger screen, it is helpful that I can widen the margins to keep a similar width for quicker and easier reading.My only complaint is that the bezel is becoming so small, you feel like you need to hold the edge more carefully. This took a little getting used to and then I didn't need to think about it. A suggestion that I'd make to Amazon is to incorporate a setting that would allow the reader to modify how much of the screen is touch sensitive so that you can widen the margins and touch the page without turning to the next page. Another thought is that Amazon might want to develop an ergonomic cushioned attachment that makes gripping the device a little more comfortable.It definitely feels like a good upgrade over the last model. Even the battery seems to have a higher capactiy. I read yesterday with the wifi on for over 3 hours and was still at 95% battery. It's somewhat misleading when Amazon claims that the battery lasts for weeks. I use a kindle pretty much daily, and I like to have the wifi on so that it sinks up with my audible library. I was usually charging my last paperwhite 2x per week. I'll be interested to see how this compares after a little bit of time. Moving to USB-C is very appealing. I'll be glad to be 100% done with micro USB, not to mention the faster charging times will be very welcome.Overall, I'm very happy with the new device. All of the upgrades seems useful and not at all gimmicky. It's a lot more device for about the same amount of money.

    I had a kindle about 9 years ago and just could not get on with it. I found it really cumbersome to navigate, the light was awful, it just was not an enjoyable experience at all.I figured I would try one again given that tech can change a lot in 9 years. Oh my goodness! I don‚Äôt think I will ever go back to reading paper books again. The dark mode is wonderful for late night reading, the touchscreen is so responsive, the page turns are practically instant, it‚Äôs so easy to navigate. I love that I can adjust the lighting and warmth. This is a completely different device to the earlier Kindles. It is an absolute joy to use, and if I lost it, or broke it, I would not hesitate to get another one right away.My single only complaint is the rubber like coating on the back. I think I would enjoy using the kindle without a case, but the back attracts such ugly smudges and marks that I can‚Äôt stand to look at it. It‚Äôs absolutely not a dealbreaker, but the only thing that could do with a change.

    Amazon has hidden this top review.
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Reduced to one star for review manipulation by Amazon. No reason given. Garbage reviews now dominate the top slot. This is a comprehensive and thorough review, which had the top spot for months on end. And then they just decided to hide it for no reason at all.This was the top review, and it's easily the most comprehensive, but Amazon apparently has hidden it away from people now. Oh well I guess.Summary:+ Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date+ Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle+ UI improvements+ Weight and feel are exceptional- Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness- Flipping through Library is still abysmal when large- Previous Kindles still do things in much the same wayComing from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it's a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It's never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it's worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it's not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I'll say this issue really doesn't affect me much.Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still  has a fully stable lighting array that doesn't evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it's not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won't even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.For memory and storage, I can't see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone's lifetime.As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they've had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this Kindle. The ONE MAJOR caveat, just like your Cart items for the regular Amazon site, is that Library is becoming absolutely obscene to sift through. It's not something that is okay anymore. They need a major list overhaul feature for people with hundreds of books. Amazon UI designers still have a lot of issues they need to fix, but since this applies to all Kindles, it doesn't have much to do with this particular device.Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don't really like the Oasis 3, but it's definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can't stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it's mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.Battery life seems improved. I wouldn't call it all that great on full brightness, but it's definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, yet I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It's tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This obviously produces a charge that lasts a very long time. With hibernation, I have no issues with battery life, but it's only a few months old.Stemming from that thought, I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren't going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn't really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It's a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle.The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don't think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It's a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option.Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for anybody in the market. Will it replace my physical collection? Never.

    Now even worse! Do the makers ever use Kindles?
  
",1.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Update, They just updated my new Kindle so that it no longer works well at allDid away with pages and went to a screen of unknowable length with no way to navigate.The scroll bar is a joke with no control, so you must move one item at a time.Why do the software people hate them now?Called for support again.  She was much better than the last but after over 20 minutes experimenting, the nice lady said the system had changed so much that the old options are no longer available.  All she could do was return the setup to where it was marginally working and not user friendly.She claimed Amazon monitored and cared, but their actions indicate otherwise.The original Kindles were so great.Why do the software people hate them now?We are so frustrated that we cannot categorize and find the books that are on the kindle.When I sought help, they told me I had to search on my PC or phone, but that doesn't help find what's on the kindle. When I said that was r*diculous, they said they didn't like that word.Go back to pages rather than one screen you cannot scroll through.Consider going to another device if you want usability.Does Nook do better?

    The Upgrades are Worth It
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I've had a Paperwhite for over 8 years and have never felt any need to upgrade.  However, the Prime Days deal on this latest model was so good that I couldn't pass it up. The new features are worth it to me -- slightly larger screen that actually makes a big difference, more robust library management software, and an adjustable amber light setting that is more enjoyable than I anticipated. Plus the battery life is pretty astounding.  I've only charged it once so far since purchasing it.

    Great Kindle PaperWhite 2021
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    The new Kindle PaperWhite 202 is so light &  easier on your eyes. I also find the screen size wonderful. My previous Kindle stopped working & since I love to read it was a catastrophe. The new Kindle 2021 was available & I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The battery last longer, you have a choice of amber light! Best investment for all who appreciate e-readers!

    Incredible touch response
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    After the sluggish touch response of my 2018 Paperwhite, this 2021 edition is a dream.  As a matter of fact, it is a dream in every way.  Another reviewer on here commented that you will never need another ereader.  I agree.P.S.  I sure do hate the new software update on all the kindle ereaders, though!

    Love the back lights.
  
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    Love the non glare screen and back light that you can dim in the evenings and take out the blue light spectrum so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with sleep. Sure beats having to put a clip light on it.

    So far I love it. Almost perfect.
  
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"







  
  
    I‚Äôve only had it a few days, but so far it‚Äôs great. It is much more comfortable reading on this kindle rather than the Fire Tablet.  The size is great and feels comfortable while holding. It just seems like you can‚Äôt remove audible titles from the device without going through somewhere else and permanently deleting them. I want them, I just don‚Äôt want to see them on this device. Also, I wish you could read and listen to books at the same time.  Connecting to the internet is a nice feature, but not good enough to use frequently.Space does not seem like it will be an issue unless you plan on buying thousands of books or having hundreds of audible books on there at the same time.I would recommend this to any reader or someone who needs a kick in the pants to read more. You can even connect to the library and send books to your kindle for free.  Get the ad free version. In the long run, I think you‚Äôll be happy with that decision.

    My first lasted a very long time.  I think about ten years.  I took it everywhere.  So very convenient.  When the inevitable day came when it stopped holding a charge, I replaced it immediately.  It is so easy to read.  The battery holds a charge for a very long time and it is simple to navigate.
